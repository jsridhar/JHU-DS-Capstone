For Barbara Hall its about selfpreservation and selfinterest and thats what this is all about Immigrants dont come to Canada to contribute to the country they come to enrich themselves from Canadas bounty Its pure selfishness and any social benefits that spring forth from this selfishness is just an unintended consequence When gathered under the banner of community this concentrated selfinterest makes demands on the host society with the goal of extracting economic and political power unto itself with the hopes that this surrendered power will trickle down to the individual and advance his or her ambitions which is what is clearly at work in the linked article Repeat this many times across the nation to reflect each community and you have yourself an unified dissatisfied ungovernable body politic

There was a frown on his face as he opened the refrigerator door a little faster than he should have The condiments inside the door rattled He blamed himself It had seemed like the sensible choice to live as naturally as possible They had embraced it both of them It had made so much goddamn sense to avoid the additives and preservatives the pesticides to guard against pollutants and chemicals to live naturally to do things Right They had thought they were doing everything right Donna had breastfed she had used the filter masks since day one of the pregnancy and they had even gone organic and gotten rid of every unnatural item They had fallen hook line and sinker for the whole damn Biotics philosophy

Thats not all I wanted to write about it her birthday is still coming That day specifically a year ago from Monday I gave birth to my sweet little Savanna As I sit and think about that day and how she took us completely by surprise in so many ways I also began to think of that person That other Tabatha The person I used to be I find myself envying that person The old me the predead daughter me I always knew of all the things that could happen The things to be aware of Ways to reduce risks but like so many I was naive I just knew I was the exception to the rule Nothing would happen to MY daughter things like that that happens to other people I read about those people but to me Nope I get a pass a get out of jail free card Clearly I am no exception to that rule and i realize I miss being that person sometimes Because now now I am afraid of everything In the end I know the Lords purpose will be delivered and whatever the destiny may be is what shall be done But I am still human That thought can only comfort me for so long there are still pieces of me that fight the darkness of thinking of EVERYTHING that could go wrong not just what happened with us Miscarriage stillbirth diseases infections the list could go on forever

Dont worryNo koalas have been harmed during my bento making process Do you know that koalas are not only grey but there are some white ones too even though theyre quite rare I wanted to make another koalathemed bento because I really like my first koala bento I thought about using quail eggs and colouring them grey but I really didnt know and still dont know how to get greycoloured eggs but then I remembered that not all koalas are grey there are white ones too how convenient in the end I didnt even have to colour anything I decided to use mini mozzarella cheese instead of quail eggs to make the two mini white koalas because I like the idea of eating pilaf with mozzarella These mozzarella koalas are made out of mozarella cheese nori for eyes black olive for the nose and chili sauce for the rosy cheeks
Ironically if we look through the Bible we see the ones God chose to do big things for His kingdom were not just those that strived to follow God they were also the sinners Rahab a harlot helped Joshua and his soldiers hide as the prepared to capture they city of Jericho King David had an affair with Bathsheba got her pregnant and had her husband killed and yet he was considered to be a man after God‚Äôs own heart We see that He can take any situation and turn it around for His glory I believe the greatest testimonies are built on those that God has restored

Im sure Im not alone when I say this but I really wanted to launch my own radio station after I saw Pump Up the Volume a shimmering glob of underrated awesomeness one that fought for your undivided attention twenty years ago but got lost in the overcrowded realm that was teen angst cinema Of course nowadays the idea of broadcasting a pirate radio show from the moldy jizzstained confines of your parents basement might seem a tad quaint‚Äìespecially in a world dominated by social media and reality television‚Äìbut in it was groundbreaking stuff Seriously a disaffected teen as the catalyst for change wasnt that farfetched during a time when apathy and yuppie culture had infected the general populace Spouting a crude yet compelling melange of saucy malapropisms on the radio complimented by an eclectic array of rap punk pop and Leonard Cohen a properly motivated adolescent in a bowling shirt could inspire the alienated and the downtrodden hovering around their speakers to do his or her bidding and do so with an alarming ease It didnt matter if person doing the talking originally intended to shake things up your voice was singled out as the champion for those being buttsurfed by the system whether you like it or not My pirate radio station for example would have been an eardestroying cacophony of postindustrial sex music and italo disco with weather and fashion updates on the hour In other words while my stations chic temperament would never be in doubt its seemingly innocuous content wouldnt cause the shady bureaucrats who the run local high school to loose any sleep The radio station featured in this film on the other hand oozes of subversion from every pore

This morning was busy ‚Äì rooms to clean and tidy with rather a few total changeovers We had a number of guests leaving us today including a lovely Japanese girl who was taking a quick break with us before heading back to Edinburgh to continue her studies She popped into the lounge yesterday and sat with me chatting about this and that regarding her life in Japan and Edinburgh I really appreciated her taking the time to share a little of her experiences with me and wished that we had more time together to get to know each other properly
But my mind is made up

The freedom and freshness of the open waters is something that cannot be easily described It must be experienced to get its full effects The one way to do this is on a yachting holiday The cost is not as high as you might think but will depend on where you are going and the level of luxury you are expecting Many people‚Äôs expectations of yacht may be no more than a little wooden boat with some sails but with yacht charter we are talking about something that can be very luxurious indeed In fact if you are looking for a yacht with sails some of the most beautiful examples are the gorgeous twin hull catamarans which have stability beyond belief Most yacht charters however involve the super extravagant diesel powered yachts which are more like ships but quicker
For my part I managed to remain relatively calm and nonawkward throughout the weekend I refrained from my horrible mildly offensive Southern accent made charming conversation and shook hands and made eye contact at the appropriate times And when I got on the plane Sunday night I breathed a sigh of relief that lasted until we pulled up to the gate at Laguardia airport
What The Fires shows heavily in ways that make it occasionally tough to read is thankfully not how dangerous data or modeling can be meaning this isn‚Äôt some oppositional screed but how relying exclusively on statistical models is the same degree of wild hubris as relying purely on instinct on feel Most impressively though is how The Fires shows that the problems which led to NYC‚Äôs fires in the ‚Äs had everything to do with information specifically its lack For instance for all the statistical analysis O‚ÄôHagan and his RAND guys could run they were woefully inexperienced with slumbuilding fires those which ravaged buildings which for instance had been changed from the original structures in small but critical ways but which changes hadn‚Äôt been registered or inspected

And in retrospect I am glad I went and I regret that I went It was very bitter sweet the whole thing I am glad for what the movie gave me which is perspective It showed me how I should be grateful for more How many of us are missing the point entirely We are so caught up in all of these physical trappings‚Ä and for what To watch these people‚Äôs lives completely torn apart by this huge wave‚Ä it really shifted how I view things In the documentary there was a guy who lost his life over his car Instead of running up the mountainside with his friend to escape the ever rising wave he ran back to he new car because it was new and expensive And this guy watched his best friend die Over a car I think this really embodies what a lot of people I know are like We are so caught up in our stuff we miss the real meaning of being here

All that walking is as rejuvenating as the sleep and relaxation Its also a key to eating pastry without guilt or weight gain We typically cover miles a day in Paris but with all that walking were paradoxically less hungry My theory is that the food we are eating is so delicious that we need less of it to feel satisfied Weve never dined at any restaurant with a star Michelin or otherwise while in Paris We prefer to find neighborhood bistros or stock up on cheeses fruit bread and chocolate at the little epicerie around the corner from our hotel The epicerie is pricier than a grocery store but they have a fabulous selection of cheeses and they make amazing puff pastry tomato tarts with pesto Or we pick up a couple of pastries from a patisserie always checking Paris P√tisseries first We open our window and stare down at the rooftops of the city we love while enjoying our room picnic

First of all youre going to need some place to stay Having friends to stay with is great especially if they work so much staying at their place is the only way to actually meet them but my most heartily recommendation would be to check in at the Hongdae Guesthouse Yellow Submarine For a sum less than a nightly taxi fare to the outskirts of Seoul not to mention saving the trouble of getting a taxi at that hour as a foreigner especially one thatll actually consider taking you there you get a bed to stay in close to Hongdae a mere minute walk from all the noise which as far as Im concerned is just perfect Theres internet and breakfast but most importantly the people running the place are fantastic human beings The guests Ive encountered there have all been great too so even if your plans are canceled lastminute you can be sure to have a great time just hanging out with the hostel people Id pick the Yellow Submarine over a fancy hotel any time and even now when my situation has changed so that I couldnt stay there myself I drop by just to say hi This has nothing to do with Korean indie music but is the most valuable tip I can provide

Afghan jihad is the greatest incident in the recent history of Muslim Ummah For the last years none of the Muslim resistance movements have been successful except Afghan Jihad From Tipu Sultan to SirajudDola from ‚Äòs war of independence to Imam Shamil‚Äôs resistance and Umar Mukhtar‚Äôs struggle the Muslim nations were captured enslaved and weakened politically and militarily For the last years where ever in the Muslim world there were resistance movements Muslims were defeated The need of these resistance movements arose because of the demise of the Ummah as a whole Only a few valiant brave men like Tipu Sultan or SirajudDola returned those debts which were not even due on them Because of the collective faults of the Ummah they had to bear the brunt of the downfall of the Muslims They had the option to live for years the life of a jackal but these men of Allah preferred the life of a lion even if it was for one day They lived like lions and due to their valour succeeded in this world and the next But their martyrdom was not able to change the fate of Muslim Ummah because it had been destined that the Ummah would suffer for a while The punishment of the collective faults of the Ummah was great indeed

Another cost thats often overlooked in the hand versus machine washing debate is the cost of the machines manufacture freight from the place of manufacture to where you buy it and then to home Add to that the waste they become when they break down or wear out All these costs have to be weighed up and considered If you have a large family work outside the home and have little home time youll probably decide youre willing to pay the various costs If like me youre in a small family with occasional large family groups you might think the cost is too high and hand wash Either way though its a private decision for all of us As always I dont expect you to follow what we do here I expect you to do what suits you and the way you work and be proud of that

Speculation runs wild Some take a fairly charitable view one reviewer sees the exclusion of Plath and Ginsberg as proof that Dove ‚Äúis her own woman‚Äù bravely going off in her own direction Facebook has lit up with chatter on the anthology very little of it positive at least from what Ive seen It‚Äôs been noted that many of the excluded poets publish under HarperCollins imprints and one source claims that HarperCollins wanted some very steep reprint fees If this is the case one wonders whether it might have been a deliberate attempt to torpedo a rival press‚Äô anthology Some of these issues are touched on in Dove‚Äôs introduction in which she complains about permissions fees One wonders if this can be the whole story Penguin is by no means an undercapitalized venture and people at the press must have known that glaring exclusions like this would seriously hurt the academic market for the book But what else could explain the exclusions

Functionally al Qaeda draws most of its operatives from the Arab world although it has connections to many organizations globally which means that the bulk of the sociology within al Qaeda is Arab In the Arabic world the topdown mentality has been present from its inception in the ancient hydraulic empires which inculcates a yesman mentality and one that seeks to shift blame from oneself to others As described in the program on the Discovery Channel OBL demanded the absolute truth from his operatives because he wanted a clear idea of just what was going on out there That went against the grain of Arab culture and you do have to wonder just how much selfcensorship and blame shifting was going on to distort OBLs views of his own organization The US military relies more on its NonCommissioned Officers to keep things running than its generals as it is a distributed responsibility system that puts lower level responsibility at the lower levels al Qaeda did and continues to do just the opposite

The house and area is now too dangerous for human habitation ie residential purposes All this due to the short sightedness of the government in not insisting the National Highways Authority build storm gutters alongside the highway they have been constructing for seven years which incidentally also went under water on the th Oct And also the government‚Äôs inability to stop individuals or sawmillers etc from building on or blocking natural water flows

Toys ‚ÄòR‚Äô Us employees do not actually set up the displays they leave this up to the vendor but they should be aware of the merchandise being sold in their stores nonetheless These comic books are sold at the front checkout counters so they are highly visible to employees managers customers and children Unfortunately children are now being exposed to samesex marriage in a toy store This is the last place a parent would expect to be confronted with questions from their children on topics that are too complicated for them to understand Issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon which is becoming extremely common and unnecessary

But sometimes artists will blur the line between expression and communication Some art can be put out in public expressing something the artist wants to say but with absolutely no hope that it will be understood that way Its sometimes not about communicating Its about expressing And the public can take it or leave it It simply doesn‚Äôt always matter to the artist Or it does if the artist has confused how well expression qualifies as communication‚Ä Sometimes art can be more about the personal catharsis of the maker than any consideration for the audience Like an inarticulate cry from a mountain top a dream induced whimper in the night The artist can be so focused on what something means to him or her that they don‚Äôt understand or sometimes even care that the public may not see the same things or seeing them agree And that is the difference between expression and communication

 Europe is easy Backpacking in Europe is like taking candy from a baby Because it‚Äôs so developed the entire continent is very tourist friendly Sure you‚Äôll have panicky moments and times when you‚Äôre lost but overall everything there is nicely laid out There is a well developed train system hostels are abundant and flights are cheap All great points but one of the aspects I like about backpacking is the challenge of it and discovering along the way what you‚Äôre really made of Stepping out of your comfort zone is one of the key experiences of backpacking Think of it this way will you get more fulfillment and a sense of accomplishment through a preorganized tour group or a trip you planned yourself Not to mention once you‚Äôve been to other places when you do go to Europe it‚Äôll be cake

Certain persons have been begging me for the past five years to write about war against the Turks and encourage our people and stir them up to it and now that the Turk is actually approaching my friends are compelling me to do this duty especially since there are some stupid preachers among us Germans as I am sorry to hear who are making the people believe that we ought not and must not fight against the Turks Some are even so crazy as to say that it is not proper for Christians to bear the temporal sword or to be rulers also because our German people are such a wild and uncivilized folk that there are some who want the Turk to come and rule All the blame for this wicked error among the people is laid on Luther and must be called ‚Äúthe fruit of my Gospel‚Äù just as I must bear the blame for the rebellion and for everything bad that happens anywhere in the world

I recently reread A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Like many of my books it was originally my mothers and I vaguely remembered reading it when I was younger When I found an index card tucked in the pages with my name and a sequence of numbers on it I realized with glee that it was my th grade locker combination I loved every minute rereading the story of Francie and her family Pretty much all of my reading happens in one of two places on the train to and from work or in bed Sometimes I get a little selfconscious after being completely absorbed in a book on a crowded train‚ÄîI can only imagine the faces I must have been making as teary eyed I read the scene where Francies mother shoots the man attempting to attack Francie in the stairwell When I realized I was at my stop I shoved the book in my bag and noticed some middleaged guy was giving me a similar look to the ones I give the people shouting nonsensically in public Yes that happens I blogged about it But hey if my funny faces keep a fellow commuter entertained on their commute so be it

Initially it is advisable know concerning the relationship choices which can be found on the net relationship site You truly should know what type of relationship you want to have which means do you want to solely concentrate on discovering a model new accomplice or only a friendship However some providers are going to give attention to soul mate relationships corresponding to a long term companion but when you will use these type of sites you have to be aware of this reality because everybody might be on the identical page so noone will get caught out by a nasty surprise If you‚Äôre not likely sure about your intentions then perhaps avoiding the sites that are going to be the ‚Äòsoul mate‚Äô sites and that means you can start off slowly and perceive what you want Nonetheless multi relationship services won‚Äôt be the very best to clearly know what a person is on the lookout for in a relationship
‚ÄúBody‚Äù was a term which the Apostle Paul‚Äôs first letter to the Corinthians used to describe the Body of Christ This term Body was used by the Roman Empire to explain how diverse its empire was It showed how each member of the Roman Empire had their proper place So if you are a hand of the ‚ÄúBody‚Äù do not seek to serve other capacities within the empire To do so would be a revolutionary act So while the Apostle Paul‚Äôs use of the Body metaphor was to serve as a transformative agent which I will explain shortly Rome‚Äôs interest for the same was to maintain its status quo using a hierarchial power

Matt Chandler Pastor at The Village Church in Texas writes this book to separate the assumed Gospel from the explicit Gospel I know all Christians think they have heard the Gospel and know it well But maybe not I know a lot of Christians personally who do not know it well and who may have never heard the explicit Gospel in their lives This does not mean that people who love and trust Jesus are not saved It just means their understanding of their own salvation and their own God that they serve is clouded incomplete and sometimes unbiblical and errant

What few survivors remained after this burning war trod a world inhospitable to life They turned inward and dug deep into the bowels of the earth where fires burned eternal and here they held onto a pathetic simulacrum of their former lives rooting out a meager existence Bent by the weight of destruction above bowed by the cloistering caverns of their new life and forever peering into the dangerous darkness that bound them the survivors struggled for many long generations before feeling the diminished caress of the faded sun on their faces When they emerged at last into the light of day the world was an unrecognizable inhospitable red desert with barely enough air to fill the lungs and a dark red sun blazing above It was infinitely better than the tunnels they left

The Third Board of Appeal dismissed Beifas appeal It held that since the earlier mark had not been declared invalid by the competent German authorities under the relevant provisions of the Markengesetz it had to be regarded as a distinctive sign within the meaning of Article e of Regulation the Community Design Regulation For the purposes of that provision an earlier sign does not need to be reproduced identically in a subsequent Community design it is sufficient that it be incorporated as such in that design Whats more although there were some differences between the design in dispute and the earlier mark it was possible to discern the characteristic features of that mark in the design which meant that use of the design in dispute would be in breach of the exclusive rights conferred on Stabilo as proprietor of the earlier mark under Paragraph of the Markengesetz and that Article e of Regulation No applied This being so there was no need for the Board to rule on the relevance of other evidence relied on by Stabilo in support of its application for a declaration of invalidity including a judgment of January of the Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main

In third part of this work Schenk devotes an entire chapter to examining the political social and military situations in Spain Naples and Greece and suggests that the revolutionary movements of these nations shortly after the Napoleonic Wars were suppressed by the European powers who aimed to maintain stability throughout the continent Following an examination of these nations Schenk recounts the events that he argues led to the dissolution of the Concert of Europe These include France‚Äôs unilateral interference in to restore the Spanish monarchy the competition between France Spain Great Britain and the United States over trading rights and the revolutions in Latin American and finally the competition between Britain and Russia in the Middle East These great power competitions argues Schenk led to the disintegration of the Concert of Europe In the epilogue Schenk again returns to Tsar Alexander I and his ideas for a European alliance and seems to suggest that British interests especially trading interests in the Middle East and Americans were hostile to Alexander‚Äôs ideas and prevented the alliance system from working and that the constant competition between the powers demonstrate that Europe remained a secularized region that failed to embrace religion

For those who despise Robert Moses and there are many the Gowanus Expressway built under his auspices could easily be the poster child for the dark side of urban development Deterioration has only added insult to injury It does provide a much needed connection between various boroughs and through Brooklyn but at a very hefty price particularly aesthetic The highway as seen from street level is hideous blocks light and dominates the avenue There have been talks and plans over the years of taking the elevated structure down and replacing it with a tunnel but to date nothing has been decided

It is much like person to person communication I can sit down and talk to you and may have something interesting and important to say but if you dont like my tone or my facial expressions or the way I constantly smack my lips while speaking or never make eye contact or talk with my mouth full then its not likely youll want to listen to me for very long

Through that prism these years might be described by the adage of ‚Äúseparating the wheat from the chaff‚Äù But where does the ‚Äúchaff‚Äù go Is it gone for good Countless studies show a significant decline in neural connectivity in individuals after the first decade or so of their lives but I struggle with believing that the vast ocean of raw intellect so fundamental to our nature dries up so significantly as we grow Creation doesn‚Äôt lose its roots no matter how much evolution occurs precursors are merely absorbed by descendants in perpetual optimization for the continuation of life Likewise I don‚Äôt believe we ever lose that ocean of infinite possibilities that we are born into no matter how far we might stray from its shore in our waking lives Therefore I propose that the ‚Äúchaff‚Äù remerges with the ‚ÄúMind at Large‚Äù to resurface in our dreams and to a lesser degree for most of us in our imaginations

For the time being I wanted to share a recipe inspired by Nigella Lawsons Chocolate Pudding I made a few changes to this basic pudding and served it warm with a side of orangemango sorbet This was the easiest chocolate dessert and the perfect recipe to have on hand when you have a late night chocolate craving and not much in your fridge It starts with plump canned pears which help keep the pudding really moist Although I usually prefer using fresh fruit canned fruit really work here They are plump and soft and the extra juice they release gives the pudding a satisfying saucy consistency This sure hits the spot

Talking about shortcomings I did a doozy on Saturday morning Someone ignored the threat of frost and did not put my car away I have a standing appointment at every Saturday morning When I looked out my back door all I could see was my frost laden car windows When you live alone you soon learn that the problem is yours to solve so I quickly decided to just go out and start the car and it would melt by the time I had to go Sounds simple enough doesn‚Äôt it Everything went well as I started the car turn on the button to defrost the rear window turned on the heater fan and went back into the house feeling quite proud of myself I was ready to go a little early but decided that early is better than late so went out knowing that all was under control Imagine my startled demeanor when I noticed that the back window was cleared but the rest of the windows were still icy Everything turned to panic as I found the car was locked and I had not seen my second set of car keys since I came home from church on Good Friday afternoon

I couldn‚Äôt see everything so I walked around the house to find a better view There were two windows on the first side of the house The first was a window for the kitchen It was a mess pots and pans were everywhere The next window was a bedroom It was trashed too except for the bed which had a woman passed out across it She looked like a typical prostitute Short skirt and a tub top I knocked on the window She stirred and sat up I knocked again and she turned around and saw me I smiled She got up and stumbled toward the window She stared at me then opened it

His one ear hung tattered and torn flapping loosely in time to the rhythmic waving of his other perfect ear It told of battles won and lost along the ancient pathways of the elephant fields He moved steadily straight towards us filling my lens with his giant shape He was caked with mud clods of which sat in a ridge down his spine andclung to the deep wrinkles of his skin like a mountain of earth come to life Liquid golden eyes looked down at me focussing sharply waiting for me to move out his way He drew himself up to enormous height My camera pointed directly up now and we stared golden eye to electronic eye There was a moment hung in time Steadily the earth mountain creature swung his great head away and he moved off into the track behind us continuing on his way I breathed deeply Wow

Mashed in right where I wanted at degrees for hour This should provide a nice thick chewy mouthfeel but also it left some unfermentable sugars thatll probably give it a little bit sweeter of a taste It also led to my gravity reading being lower then I expected at around Because of the higher mash temp and my brewhouse efficiency somewhere in the range it wont be as high gravity as expected Not sure if my efficiency went down because it was too big a beer for my Mash tun or because of the higher mash temp Sparged at for minutes and started a boil with about gallons of wort that looked like it came out of an oil can I hopped the crap out of it so hopefully the bitterness will blend well with the higher amount of residual sugars created in the higher mash temp

I know that some analysts are worried particularly of Saudi Arabia being taken over by Al Qaeda or a Sunni version of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Calm down Besides my gut feeling which is rarely wrong the overwhelming majority of people speaking out and calling out for a revolution are people who want democracy and civil rights and not more of our current Arab tradition based adaptation of Sharia My theory of why that is is that Al Qaeda has already exhausted its human resources here The available muttawas are career muttawas fatwa sheikhs and minor muttawas PVPV of convenience both paid by the government and do not want the current winwin deal between them and the government to sour So it‚Äôs unlikely that they would actively seek change Actually quite the opposite they will resist and delay as much as they can Fortunately the winds of change can‚Äôt be deterred by a PVPV cruiser

I give him credit for that James Cameron isn‚Äôt so much an old dog learning new tricks as he is an old dog learning new philosophy You can knock him for not having all the answers yet or for relying on a few too many Hollywood tropes better left behind but unlike the bulk of his characters Cameron seems to finally have figured out that the journey is every bit as important as the destination It‚Äôs gonna be interesting to see where the AVATAR story goes from here

I dont actually believe that at bottom writing historical fiction is any different from writing any other kind of fiction characterisation structure prose plot process Were writing for readers now and so all those things must work for witers and readers Now But the usual challenges come in different proportions because of the fundamental definition of historical fiction at least that of Margaret Atwood which is the only definition which is useful for a writer fiction set in a time before the writer came to consciousness

The targeted killing program violates both US and international law As we‚Äôve seen today this is a program under which American citizens far from any battlefield can be executed by their own government without judicial process and on the basis of standards and evidence that are kept secret not just from the public but from the courts The government‚Äôs authority to use lethal force against its own citizens should be limited to circumstances in which the threat to life is concrete specific and imminent It is a mistake to invest the President ‚Äî any President ‚Äî with the unreviewable power to kill any American whom he deems to present a threat to the country

You might tell me now that these two positions just describe some fantasies young girls or notsoyoung women might nurture in private but I think their huge popularity is quite dangerous as it also says something about the society at large and more specifically about women as both authors and the majority of their audiences are females If you write about rape orand manipulating the other human being by using any form of pressure sex included in positive terms some people will think it is basically a proper behaviour whereas in reality it is just abuse plain and simple Women have spent years trying to get equal treatment still a matter of distant future in so many countries even in Western Europe and in the USA and now some spoilt female authors write tasteless fantasies about being stalked beaten

Guineas fly and they will head to the tallest tree and roost there so I need to have them trained enough to come down at night and roost in the barn where the hen house is located Otherwise I am sure the owls or hawks will have one dandy dinner So this is another reason for my logic ‚Äì they will befriend the chickens and follow them to roost at night‚Ä‚Äright

There are to be blunt huge leaps made in McKnight‚Äôs historical analysis here and it is intriguing the way in which he highlights the creeds positively where Wright had identified their current usage as part of the problem more on that another day But it is important to focus on the larger point that McKnight is making that today‚Äôs Western Christianity largely discards the actual historical element in the gospel in favor of a dehistoricized propositional salvation message and somewhat mystical experience Of course we must not discount an individual‚Äôs or community‚Äôs experience of the living Christ nor can we say there are no propositions present in the basic gospel message Nevertheless McKnight wants us to be focusing elsewhere on an element that has been buried for some time ‚Äì the robust story of which the gospel is the culmination

So today during the funeral services I was feeling especially tender and vulnerable It was a lovely and poignant memorial with the family sharing the tributes providing the music and making everyone appreciate being there Kathy had the honor and privilege of caring for her mother in her home for the past several months and I was touched and inspired by the loving way Kathy surrendered all her own needs to unselfishly and beautifully serve her year old mother She was an example of service and love and I was keenly aware that I could not have done what she did As I listened to all the speakers I was treated to an understanding of why Kathy has so many talents and interests as well as outright gifts She was the third and last daughter and in that position in the family she got to witness and learn from all of the others and she has been a stellar student I must say Kathy is one of the most exceptionally interesting unique and talented women I know I could see where she got her love of poetry and writing of performing her musical talents and her amazing way with people It has been said that life can only be understood by looking backwards but it must be lived forward the message in Its a Wonderful Life We all need the reminder sometimes of how amazing life is how much we need each other how we are all connected how our lives intertwine and affect everyone around us I must say there was such love in evidence at the funeral and maybe thats the real gift in them I have had three funerals this month all close friends and relatives and I guess Im pondering my own mortality Since we never know from one moment to the next we need to pay attention to the present and make it count

From the crashing waves appeared a figure large and shaggy It skulked out of the ocean unaffected by the power and force of the waves surging around it At first it was hard to make out Even with the sky so light up the distance between the house and the shore made it hard to make out the finer details but once it cleared the water and padded up onto the beach Maria could clearly see what it was It was a wolf but nothing like any wolf she had ever seen in her picture books or heard of in the stories her mother and father would tell her This wolf was much larger and its fur was shiny white It was soaked with sea water and the light from the moon shown all across it making it seem as if it were glowing The wolf stood there on the shore just beyond the water for a long while looking out into the island with its back still turned from the sea It suddenly reared its head and gave out a howl that seemed to echo out into the night farther even that the sound of the waves It drowned out all other sounds and for a time was the only thing to be heard This startled Maria causing her to jump back less from fear and more because of the sheer intensity of the sound

When people succeed in profiting on a large scale they succeed for themselves When they fail they fail for many others sometimes for us all A large failure is worse than a small one and this has the sound of an axiom but how many believe it Propriety of scale in all human undertakings is paramount and we ignore it We are now betting our lives on quantities that far exceed all our powers of comprehension We believe that we have built a perhaps limitless power of comprehension into computers and other machines but our minds remain as limited as ever Our trust that machines can manipulate to humane effect quantities that are unintelligible and unimaginable to humans is incorrigibly strange

How does this relate to South Africa Well Africans like Europeans are monarchists at heart but even more so South African voters were entirely too easy to convince that government is the repository of all the freedoms that the citizens enjoy the allpowerful benefactor that is necessary to preserve those freedoms When freedom is translated into monetary terms as the ANC has proven itself expert at doing then true freedom is lost and the meaning of democracy is subsumed into a kind of mob rule
Let me return to the Roth quote Why does he feel that readers are declining by the decade I think to be fair to Roth he is perhaps referring to what he sees in his eyes as the ‚Äòtrue‚Äô reader He may even be tending toward what would be considered the ‚Äòliterary reader‚Äô And if he is solely referring to the ‚Äòliterary reader‚Äô then he is probably correct Yes our poor literary reader is like most general readers‚Äîpunch drunk from an industry publishing more titles that at any time ever before and trying to market and reach out to its consumer in a media market saturated to the brim with messages and products we can‚Äôt live without

I have enough knowledge about the anime industry to say that the writers really planned out this episode well within the context of the rest of the series I‚Äôm not caught up with the untranslated editions of the novel so I can‚Äôt make any comment about how the characters are supposed to turn out but I can say with confidence that the anime does its job as an adaptation transferring the story into another medium with a reasonable amount of success The original light novel‚Äôs author really comes out in the dialogue particularly because the main character‚Äôs numerous internal monologues come straight from the prose Either way the storylover in me was treated to something really nice and juicy this week and I can‚Äôt wait to write the post for next week‚Äôs episode

This is the cloud that hangs over the next odd pages as Esma offers up fragments of family history beginning with her mother‚Äôs birth in a village near the Euphrates She describes a world where women as well as men enforce an honour code that results in the social death of men who fail to act like men and the actual death of several female relatives When her family migrates to Istanbul and then to London in the early s they take that code with them but as they grow accustomed to life in the west it becomes less a system of social regulation than a compulsion they can neither control nor understand

As for the course of the story theres not much here Calliope has to complete a set of tasks before she can become the new Death and of course shes really worried about her dad and spends most of the book searching for him No wait thats what youd expect from the book But actually she spends more time thinking about her chances of boffing the hot guy in her office than worrying what happened to her dad Even in her quest shes entirely reactive She has several people to help her along and tell her what she needs to do and these same people bail her out when she screws up Even when these characters get knocked out of the narrative she still finds someone to rescue her from dire situations including at one point God himself

Elizabeth says to get over that intimidating thought construct she had to Create a distance between me and my expectations of my writing since that freakish success Her way of doing that was to come up with a new way of thinking about creativity and that search led her to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome Back then people did not believe creativity came from human beingscreativity was a devine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source

Wow super inviting nose Caramel a light touch of whiskey and fruity sweetness Just awesome After the first sip the first thing I did was check out the ABV on the bottle just because it was so smooth and it turned out to be and I couldnt believe it I didnt expect anywhere over at the most Hiding an ABV like that is pretty amazing Tons of caramel and sweet fruit like plums and apples followed by some vanilla and oak to smooth it all out Hints of the whiskey come out but its really well integrated and the barleywine holds up to the barrel incredibly well Just a fantastic beer

More than anything it‚Äôs a fascinating portrait of a newspaper which isn‚Äôt currently embroiled in the alltoofamiliar scandals and political pointscoring of UK ones Any political agenda it has is completely lost on me not being American or as actively political as I could be Instead viewed as a complete outsider it becomes an interesting look at not just how a newspaper functions in the perceived Age Of Free but what drives the people who keep the wheels ‚Äì and the presses ‚Äì running

This seems rather strange as most of the people who follow permaculture and are interested in this sort of thing are people who are concerned with the state of the world and want a naturally sustainable barter system to become prevalent so that we can halt the destruction All of this is fantastic in theory but then they want to charge you hundreds of pounds to learn Obviously if this is their livelihood then they have to charge something but it really isnt accessible to the people who would probably implement it the most out of sheer necessity so they are cutting out a whole swathe of the population who would help save the world because they dont have enough money to live the consumer type lifestyle we are all caught up in

There are two stages The one is causing in what the toxic people‚Äôs jargon is called ‚Äúplugs‚Äù And they have the audacity to say things like ‚Äúwhat I am doing now is not really dangerous‚Äù in an effort to put the targeted person off guard This idea may or may not be conscious and may be something the person would dismiss In the first instance it indicates that there is no danger However note also that such a statement is general so it can be used as a suggestive idea This is most often mistaken by an unsuspecting person as firstly their own idea and not a presentation and secondly to have meaning with respect to something that the person is doing And here again I want to emphasise that the toxic mob does not divine anything out of the blue They have more than reliable information they have definite information because it is always ‚Äúan inside job‚Äù Someone close to the victim has reason for doing the harm A stroke even more than a heart problem amounts to a most brutal means of gaining power and influence over another person

Thank you for sending me The List by Joe Konrath I liked the setup for this novel a great deala detective investigation a murder finds that the victim shares the same enigmatic tattoo that he possesses Unfortunately I just didnt think the rest of the novel could sustain that sense of eerie anticipation The reason for the tattoos that all participants were part of a secret government cloning experiment just seemed a little too familiar and the constant joking while witty at times also eroded the tension and sense of menace I appreciate the look and hope another editor feels differently Bantam Dell Publishing Group

When a good history of the George W Bush years is finally written his breakthrough with India may turn out to be the most important foreign policy initiative of his administration The Indian Ocean hosts lanes for the oil from the Persian Gulf and an ever larger share of its trade and India sits in the middle of it It is also the geographical center of transnational Islamic terrorism It is essential that the United States maintain a strong deterrent in the Indian Ocean and that it preserve and enhance its ability to coerce whatever clown revue happens to be governing Pakistan at the moment India is the key to both That Barack Obama recognizes this is to his credit It is quite possibly the most deft foreign policy move of his administration admittedly a low standard and he deserves credit for it

I have to confess that reading reviews of our album LoveTel Motel gives me a real sense of pleasure and achievement After all making this album was a real labour of love for all of us involved including Ian Jackson our engineer and sometimes fifth Magic Shipper I would say that everybody seems to like different things about it and as far as I am concerned everybody will have their own take on each of the songs and what their own particular favorites are And why not That after all is why we make music to put out into the public domain It is not my place to argue with somebody elses personal taste especially if they have been gracious enough to purchase our record and for that I am certain that I also speak on behalf of the rest of the lads we are immensely grateful

Ann or perhaps Jo said that one impressive thing about the novel was the way that early on we are led to see the Garners as unusually philanthropic slave owners but later realize that this is just a matter of relativity and that they have their own cruelties I said that one of the most horrifying moments for me though was not the outandout cruelty from which its easy to distance oneself but the incident towards the end when Sethes living daughter Denver goes to the abolitionists house to ask for work Here she comes across something which horrifies her a small statue of a black child with its head pulled back and its lower lip extended to receive coins casually thrown down ready for paying tradesmen a figure so like the LittleBlackSambo collection figures that stood unremarked outside shops and in arcades in my own childhood that I was pushed up suddenly against my own unconscious collusion in racism

What about barriers to entry A world without visa restrictions would be every traveller‚Äôs paradiseThe choice to live and work anywhere would be empowering in the true sense Of course cities towns and countrysides would lose some of their distinct character as is often the case with globalization We already have ‚ÄòLittle India‚Äô and ‚ÄòChina Town‚Äô tucked away sometimes in unexpected corners of almost every city It would raise a lot of questions about the political dynamics if there are many expats living in the country A possible downfall is that under developed countries would become worse off because most people would move to developed parts of the world leaving their own countries underpopulated and crowding others Or maybe it would reduce the differences in development between regions

Finally I‚Äôll say that the word immortal is used in a couple of ways in the book Immortal can refer to the cells and their ability to grow in culture It can also refer to something spiritual As such it is the word that perfectly emphasizes the disconnect between the doctors and scientists and the Lackses Many of the scientists and doctors in the book save for the courageous Christophe Lengauer see only the scientific definition of the word But the family struggles and desires to understand the spiritual side‚Äîthat they believed their mother a real person was granted some sort of immortality When her cousin sings and prays with Deborah we witness a spiritual connection to Henrietta up close We end the book knowing it is not just the cells that were immortal It‚Äôs a beautiful moment

For starters if this is your favorite blog then allow me to congratulate you on having exceptional taste But back to my main point which is introducing myself My name is Andrew D and back in the fall of I purchased a book entitled Movies You Must See Before You Die I‚Äôm sure many of you movie fanatics have seen it and if not I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of it After perusing the book for a few days I decided to put myself through a sort of personal film school and watch all of the movies that the text contained I knew it was a big task but I committed myself to seeing the project through to the very end As I write this I‚Äôm currently films in and am certain that someday I‚Äôll be able to flip through that book with memories of watching each and every one of the

I was watching a sci fi show the other week and one character was telling another that the secret to happiness is being happy with what you already have‚Äìthe other responded with but if I had what made me happy I‚Äôd be happy already Many times in western culture we look at this as a metaphor for objects and love to bring this up around Christmas or Thanksgiving I think though it can run deeper than that I can go to a place of‚Äìwho I am is good enough how I was made in this world is good enough I have everything I need available to me right now just because I‚Äôm here and that we are all each of us loved just as we are‚Äìwhole complete and perfect My teacher said something once along the lines of this don‚Äôt say you don‚Äôt love yourself‚Äìof course you love yourself look at the lengths you go to just to survive I think though that I don‚Äôt always let myself feel that love open up to it Some lie inside that if I‚Äôm content I‚Äôd be stagnant‚Äìwhich of course is false I can be in life as I am in dance‚Äìjoyful content while moving and creating And appreciating the beauty of this life is also appreciating the beauty of me

So this year I decided to mix things up a bit I found a wonderful color palette blog called Design Seeds Jessica Colaluca is the brains behind that operation that takes a fresh look at color and supplies creatives like me with beautifully rendered palettes Miss Jessica was kind enough to let us play along with her palettes as long as we linked back to her site So I asked the participants to choose one color from a group of twelve This could be a complete challenge to them or something that they loved Either way I sent a totally unique palette to all players in this colorful game The only rule was that they had to use the main color that they chose At the end of this post you will find a complete list of all the hoppers I hope you will visit each one and of course leave some feedback for them to let them know what you think of their interpretations

Lark Rise by Flore Thompson Novelization of the authors childhood growing up in a very small poor rural community during the Victorian era in England I had heard good things about this and the two subsequent novels online and my local PBS station started showing the serialization made in England several years ago I decided to read the first before watching the show which is actually based on all three fictionalized memoirs by Thompson While its a very fast read this first book has very little dialogue and is almost completely descriptive While the people of Lark Rise seem resigned enough with their lot in life theyre not really happy because they really have no experience of how things can be or were different elsewhere I came away from it very happy that I live today These people were extremely poor and reading about their diet or lack of much of one the difficulty of just scraping by and the general hard times of everyone in the village I wondered how so many viewers of the television show could find it a wonderful escape and wistfully say theyd love to live then I havent watched the show yet so maybe when you dont read about the one meal a day they ate with just a tidbit of old bacon fat to flavor it and provide some protein or the threadbare clothes lack of daily comforts including sanitation and all the other things we take for granted it may seem an idealized way of life Not to me

The official line of the red clawed multiculturalists currently holding prominent positions in our country is that the British Islands have no indigenous people and that we are a shifting race of intermingling immigrants with no ancestral roots into into the soil of our homeland Similar arguments are made against the claims of many native peoples across Europe for instance as Dr D a regular commentator at Sarah Maid of Albion recently put it it is now all but official policy in Sweden that ‚Äúthere is no Swedish identity no Swedish history no Swedish way of life Everything is given over to the Other the Other that is superior to all things native‚Äù Sweden is an extreme case but the same is happening in country after country across the continent

Fourth the film darkly addresses human nature with an ending that leaves Alex more or less as we found him at the beginning The movie seems to say that free will is essential to human existence ‚Äî that we must be able to choose to be good or bad otherwise we cease to be little more than slaves or robots Some people are inherently good or evil or weak ‚Äî and there‚Äôs not always an explanation or solution for it The government does not fare much better in the film‚Äôs eyes They try to fix Alex not because it is the right or humane thing to do but to control him When Alex‚Äôs torture and suicide attempt are publicized and the government criticized for their actions they reverse the treatment and cure him to remain popular Principle is not involved Even Frank Alexander has plans to use Alex for his own leftwing political objectives until he realizes who he really is and seeks retribution

In relationships of all kinds we practice diplomatic dishonesty in many different forms Out of balance diplomatic dishonesty becomes codependence one of the most unhealthy types of controlling behavior I think It can also go out of balance in the other direction I am no fan of radical honesty Ive seen people use that excuse to say the most hurtful things you can imagine Part of being twoeyed means we can think before we speak Well we can even though sometimes its difficult We can ask ourselves what we hope to accomplish by saying whatever it is thats tickling our throats rattling the voicebox in its eagerness to get out What I really dislike about radical honesty is the idea that we should never filter what we say Should we say everything To what end

An improvement on the chain rakes is the socalled ‚Äúporcupine‚Äù machinery which has perhaps been more extensively adopted than any other form of mashing apparatus Of an example of this form of mashing machine we gave an engraving on page of our number for the th of May last our illustration representing a vertical section and plan of one of the castiron mashtuns at Messrs Truman‚Äôs brewery which mashtuns we may mention are all with one exception also fitted with Steel‚Äôs masher which we shall describe presently The mashing apparatus of which we are now speaking consists as will be seen of a series of rakes carried by curved arms fixed to a pair of horizontal shafts placed one above the other the rakes being arranged so that as the shafts revolve they pass each other and thoroughly turn over the ‚Äúgoods‚Äù in the mashtun The inner ends of the horizontal shafts are carried by plummer blocks attached to brackets which encircle the central vertical or driving shaft the lower end of which latter shaft rests upon a suitable bearing at the bottom of the mashtun The outer ends of the rake shafts rest in bearings carried by a kind of frame which is connected by tie bars with the brackets encircling the central shaft and which is supported by a pair of rollers which bear on the rim of the mashtun The upper part of this frame also carries bearings for a pair of shafts which are geared together and each of which has running loose on it a pinion which gears into a rack formed round the edge of the mashtun Each shaft also carries a sliding clutch for connectiug it to its pinion and these clutches are both worked by one lever arranged as shown in the plan so that either can be thrown in gear at pleasure but so that they cannot be engaged simultaneously One of the pinion shafts extends inwards towards the centre of the mashtun and at its inner end it carries a bevel wheel which gears into a bevel pinion on the central shaft this pinion being about onethird the size of the wheel The rake shafts also carry bevel wheels which gear into equal sized wheels on the vertical shaft the pairs of wheels being arranged so that the two rake shafts are both made to revolve in the same direction

I remember ‚ÄúI Hate You‚Äù in an ironic way The song deals with being in love with a cheater and hating the cheater for it Yet because of the love ballad groove people slow danced to it‚Äincluding yours truly A masterpiece in the same vein of the Police‚Äôs ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take‚Äù it sounds beautiful on the surface Yet when you listen to the lyrics the song ain‚Äôt what you think it is Lyrics about stalking an exlover and lyrics about a cheating woman ain‚Äôt necessarily babymaking music Yet both songs serenade you anyway
The warning shouts of Bobby‚Äôs mother came from a heart of love and concern for Bobby‚Äôs welfare and safety God warns us as well because He loves us deeply and wants to rescue us from the impending disaster of that thud in our own lives It‚Äôs easy to think of God‚Äôs warnings and prohibitions as His attempt to take all the fun out of our lives but that‚Äôs so wrong In fact nothing would give Satan more joy than getting you to think like that because the more you think like that the easier it is for him to ‚Äúdevour‚Äù you And that‚Äôs a thud that I never want to hear

Then it was my turn you stared at me for what seemed like eternity and yet I know it was no more than three and a half heartbeats in the real world When your lips touched mine I knew that this our goodbye kiss Not the last time that I would kiss you before you left but our real goodbye kiss Knowing that allowed me to memorize it completely Your hand on my waist and the other on the back of my neck my hands on your chest covering your heart I leaned in hoping the smell of you would stay with me You pulled me close until I wondered if you weren‚Äôt trying to melt me into you and take me with you when you left Your lips lingered on mine even after you stopped kissing me as if you wanted to give me your breath and steal mine at the same time I remembered when you used to do that and I would tell you that I could feel your smile that memory made the tears fall

The first mode is the New England industrial model which spread west to the Great Lakes early on and trickled gradually southward from there It‚Äôs one of the shibboleths of modern thought that industrial systems create wealth but as Alf Hornborg points out usefully in The Power of the Machine their main function is actually to concentrate wealth the wealth that would have gone to a large number of small proprietors and skilled craftspeople in a nonindustrial society goes instead to the very small minority with the money and political connections to build and run factories control access to raw materials and energy resources and the like That‚Äôs why every nation on Earth that has ever built an industrial economy within a free market system has ended up polarized between vast fortunes on the one hand and an even vaster number of hopelessly impoverished workers on the other That‚Äôs the New England model‚Äîit was also the English model but that will be relevant a bit later on‚Äîand it drives a very specific kind of imperial expansion in which sources of raw materials on the one hand and markets where industrial products can be exported on the other are the central targets of empire

Hello Everyone
Let‚Äôs look a bit more closely at why and how this works For Nietzsche the apparent selfnegation of asceticism is illusory ‚Äì it‚Äôs actually a selfaffirmation What has happened is simply that ‚Äòself‚Äô has been redefined now the self that denies ‚Äòothers‚Äô the self that is denied A faster for example identifies themselves with that force that will which is triumphing over hunger ‚Äì the will to food is treated as a subordinate an alien will to be conquered In doing so suffering is not avoided ‚Äì for the person does not cease to feel the hunger they cannot deny the fact that it remains their hunger even if they deny it ‚Äì but now that suffering can be given meaning can be turned into gratification Asceticism thus allows suffering to be converted into a sense of power

This is not what I planned to write for my first blog but something happened this afternoon that blew me away I am the viceprincipal of what I believe to be the best elementary school in Surrey The teachers and staff who work at this school truly believe in putting in the extra time and effort to connect with and get to know their students They understand that this time comes back to them tenfold when students try their best We are an innercity school and the people who choose to work here really work hard and trust that they can make a difference in children‚Äôs lives It is not always easy They may not see immediate results but they know they are making a difference by planting the seeds that will grow when the time is right You cannot rush this process
I went to Michigan last March to be interviewed for the film It was a powerful experience and I felt as though I could say all that was important to me about you and your murder I hope the film is seen by many people and that it continues to expand and open the perception of those who are narrowminded While I was there I was able to visit the PittmannPuckett Art Gallery I was proud to know that your presence continues to be felt within that organization I particularly appreciate that an art gallery was named after you and Christine Do you remember that the first college class I ever took was with you And it was art history

There are only two authors whose complete published works I‚Äôve read Samuel Beckett and Richard Brautigan By ‚Äòcomplete‚Äô I mean of course those that are still generally available And I would also have to exclude works of nonfiction Those scraps aside I‚Äôve read everything else and certainly every major work in most cases several times And most of what I‚Äôve read I own although strictly speaking my wife does own some of the Brautigan which if she dies before me I fully expect to inherit All I‚Äôm saying is that I‚Äôve got dibs on it

One of the pairings that I enjoyed the most was the Comtes de Champagne Rose Brut A pure and frank rose it was a deeper rose colour then expected being almost orangishred but having very heady aromas and a complex intense palate I enjoyed it on it‚Äôs own but served with a rose jelly was a delight the jelly not so sweet that it overpowered the champagne The red fruit character of the champagne exploded and really lingered Although it was paired with dessert I think it would have paired well with the biryani we had beforehand

Most Heavy Metal listeners arent musicians themselves I suspect an unquantifiable section of them are failed guitarists but even so failed for a reason Its depressing to see how bands with little meaning to their music are often revered by metalheads as not only important but more important than pop music because they employ technical trickery that impresses the musical illiterate Nearly everything metal music does on an aesthetic and compositional level is a more technically dense version of what more tame popular music does only with the conceit that the added chops and technicality can only exist because they serve a higher purpose Like many sophist arguments underneath the hood this is a circular argument Of course my metal is profound otherwise why would it be so complicated sounding

A vibrant social justice movement within African civil society is working to ensure the visibility of ‚Äì and enjoyment of rights by ‚Äì LGBTI people This movement is made up of people from all walks of life both identifying and nonidentifying as part of the LGBTI community It has been working through a number of strategies to entrench LGBTI issues into broader civil society issues to shift the samesex sexuality discourse from the morality debate to a human rights debate and to build relationships with governments for greater protection of LGBTI people These objectives cannot be met when donor countries threaten to withhold aid

Anyhoo on Friday night July we went over to the Univ of North Texas football stadium for fireworks This was meaningful for Pod because watching the fireworks at UNT was a family tradition back in the day so he enjoyed taking his little ones along to watch I have to say that watching fireworks in a small town has some definite advantages to the clusterfuck that is the Zilker Park fireworks Think people looking for a place to spread out instead of Think no lines for the bathrooms no lines for the concessions stands no lines for the kiddie rides Think when the program says the fireworks start at they start at on the dot Think you can still sit about yards from where they are setting off the fireworks even if you get there right when the show starts

Whats the takeaway from this long exhausting yet deeply gratifying week Maybe its something as simple as the importance of finding work that feeds the soul and keeps one focused on a world larger than oneself Both Davis and Delany have spent their lives as writers and scholars engaged with questions of race sex and justice and both seem at or on the brink of it Davis is to radiate equanimity and an optimism that seems not naive but hardwon and fiercely guarded At breakfast with a group of faculty women the morning after her lecture Davis amiably entertained more than minutes of questions on everything from prison reform to the politics of university catering She was thoughtful funny generous and sanguine about the prospect of continued if slow progress toward justice She counseled patience and emphasized the importance of building movements from the ground up She reminded listeners that the election of Barack Obama was a victory not for him but for those who voted him into office She feels that the Occupy Wall Street movement whatever else it did or did not accomplish was a sign that citizens felt empowered by Obamas election to mobilize against rising inequalities of wealth and the rise of corporate power In reply after reply it was clear Davis refuses despair She sees whats happening She grasps the underlying problems with depth and nuance And her years in the trenches tell her that it simply means we are all going to have to spend a few or many more years in the trenches All right then

WAYNE ROONEY Manchester United The Englishman unselfishly works for the team and his passion can never be questioned He steps up to the plate when the chips are down and could still win the Golden Boot Award as he trails Robin van Persie by only two goals His goals and assists are an important reason why Manchester United are still in the frame for the Premier League title

The cloud forest lies before me like a woman reclining in a steamy bath filled with foaming water All curves and hollows hills and valleys The mist collects in the valleys like the foam enveloping the woman moulding itself to her shape The water gently laps against her body constantly shifting and changing never still just as the mist ebbs and flows against the hillsides swirling in amongst the branches rising up into the canopy evaporating into the air condensing on the leaves and branches

As an aside ‚Äì you may be asking yourselves when I am quoting events at the AAUP meeting ‚Äì when the Unversity Press sector is often considered to be one of the less commercial sectors ‚Äì supported as it often is by contributions to operating cost from the parent university And the answer is that because of budget cuts many of these presses are now having to sink or swim on their own ‚Äì at the same time as facing huge pressure from librarians in particular to provide content electronically on a payperuse basis These presses are being squeezed at both ends and they have to reshape themselves fast

There is a growing fascination today with angels These men were angels and they were dressed in white apparel Who were they They were messengers from God angels Who are angels What is their sex Every time we find angels mentioned in the Bible they are men never women They were men who came to visit Abraham They were men who came to report to God in Job chapter one They were called the ‚Äúsons of God‚Äù Even the fallen angels mentioned in Genesis were called the ‚Äúsons of God‚Äù Today you find that angels are always women Why Because they are not the holy angels sent from God but the fallen angels those who followed and still follow Satan in his deceptive activity God is not the author of confusion but Satan uses confusion all the time
People need to understand that they are the product of Facebook and not the customer says media theorist and writer Douglas Rushkoff And the same applies for online content If you are not paying a price for the story that you read then you are being sold to someone else for their commercial purposes The problem for the media is that the clicks that they monetise and that you provide are not paying them enough to support the model indefinitely Which is why Rupert Murdoch has turned the Australian and the HeraldSun into paidfor websites Hes moving cautiously He has many other news websites in Australia to still get to but they will all go paid eventually As will Fairfax which operates the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age of Melbourne It has to happen

A lot of expats complain about the buses in Lima They drive too fast They are dangerous They seem to be totally unregulated But I love them This might warrant a word of explanation I don‚Äôt love that the bus drivers seem reckless that the bus I am riding could break down at any time or that there are no emissions standards so on any busy street I eventually find myself holding my breath through a cloud of black bus exhaust from some huge retired Bluebird school bus with an oil leak enjoying a second life as a public transport

As I am working to grow in Christ I encourage others to do the same Growing up in God is much different from growing up in the world When the world is inconsistent with explaining what the future will bring the Word of God gives specific and truthful breakdowns God will mercifully remove all crutches so that we may reach our full potential as the Body of Christ Rest assured that growing up spiritually in Christ is one of the most rewarding experiences in Christ if not the most rewarding Maturing in Christ brings so much joy power and authority In spiritual development other aspects of our lives are affected and will ultimately be a reflection of our everincreasing relationship with our Father Leave your childish ways behind and press on toward the goal to win the prize of which God has called us heavenward in Christ Jesus Philippians Thank You Jesus

Another line that is being pushed by Western leaders is that because the protests in Egypt and Tunisia were peaceful they proved al Qaeda ‚Äì which calls for armed struggle ‚Äì to be wrong That is another fallacy Al Qaeda is not against regime changes through protests but it is against the idea that the change should be only through peaceful means to the exclusion of the use of force In fact Shaykh Ayman alZawahiri spoke in support of the protests that swept Egypt back in and he alluded to the fact that even if the protests were peaceful the people need to prepare themselves militarily

One of my sons recently accused me of abandoning them when I left their father several years ago This was heartbreaking to me as I felt the hatred in his voice but I know I did what I felt I had to do at the time to survive When I left I took several of the children with me and told the boys if they wanted to come with me to get in the car They refused to do so so I left them with their father I tried to go back about a year later and both their father and the boys were very abusive toward me so after about a week I left again At that point I knew that they had been brainwashed by their father that I was the evil one for leaving them I wonder what may have happened if I‚Äôd stayed Would I be dead or like so many others would I have killed my abusive husband Would the boys have grown up seeing their father‚Äôs abuse of me and believe there would be no consequences to that kind of behavior Would I ever have started my ministry I don‚Äôt know what the answer is to those questions but I do know that by leaving even though I chose not to divorce I showed both their father and the boys that there are consequences to abusive behavior and that I would not live with them as long as they behaved in that manner I have been blamed by some people for leaving the relationship and blamed by others for not leaving the relationship People often don‚Äôt understand the dynamics of a domestic violence situation and offer pat answers to complicated issues I don‚Äôt know whether or not the choices I made were the best ones I could have made but they were the ones I made and we all have to live with them now I pray my sons can forgive me for ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù them physically though my heart and prayers never left them I pray that they learn there are consequences to abusive behaviors before they have to suffer more pain in their lives I pray that they learn to treat people with respect whether male or female I trust that God can and will reach their hearts with the truth and that they will be emotionally healed from any thing I may have done wrong to them Please pray with me on this

Hardcore socialists like to promote their ideology as being the opposite of racism and prejudice but their condemning KIPP as a method of teaching that is racist is beyond ridiculous and is counterproductive to lifting minority and indigent students up Real racism is encouraging a minority child to believe that he is either incapable of doing better because of his race and circumstances ‚Äúthe soft bigotry of low expectations‚Äù or is encrouaging this child to adopt a misplaced sense of entitlement that teaches because he was not born in perfect circumstances society somehow ‚Äúowes‚Äù him a free ride or at least an easy ride This is how we came to see the ‚Äúdumbing down‚Äù of America because it was assumed that minority children could not compete with white children therefore we lowered our academic standards in order not to exclude minority students from competing ‚Äî and this if anything is real racism

In summary what Thomas is saying is that Fruit Fly genome is such that further modifications cannot be made by evolution as all mutations are detrimental He is also extending this into the past effectively claiming that the D melanogaster genome is Irreducibly Complex This is again a dangerously large example if IC ‚Äì there could easily be a simpler form considering what we know from the two studies A lot of research has been done on D melanogaster and I don‚Äôt know if there has been other studies showing places where you can mutate the fly to get surviving offspring I have a hunch though that there have been documented cases of this

I also disagree that there are certain core subjects that must be learned As far as Im concerned a healthy community is made up of many people with many different skills experiences and knowledge bases The things that are important for each individual to learn are those important to that individual The idea of gaps in knowledge at all is pretty ridiculous actually when everyone can agree that there is a colossal amount of information out there No one can hope to absorb any more than a tiny fraction of the accumulated knowledge available to them so everyone no matter what their education will have gaps Its just a matter of whether the knowledge you do have is of your own choosing knowledge that is meaningful and worthwhile to you or whether its chosen by someone else and forced down your throat for your own good

Hitchcock puts a little verve into moments like that whenever he can because he doesnt have a whole lot to work with here Once the trial is over and Sir John begins his investigation the film is dominated by a series of stagey dialogues with witnesses and suspects and theres not much Hitchcock can do to make these lifelessly written scenes pop There are hints here and there of a buried homosexual subtext that was more explicit in the Clemence Dane novel the film is based on but here its mostly replaced by an undercooked racial theme The films theater milieu is full of crossdressing actors and gradually the investigation begins to focus on the trapeze artist Handel Fane Esme Percy who dresses up as a glamorous woman and flies through the air wowing the crowds with his grace Fanes feminine artistry plays into the shocking circus climax which Hitchcock stages by putting the focus on the horrified reactions of the crowd just as he had during the opening scenes

This was easily the most remarked upon painting by the kids There was disagreement about whether she was a queen or a princess she was in fact a princess Some of them felt the dark figure was there to protect her others thought he was her enemy In the background is her castle we decided or perhaps her city I tried to get them to speculate about the book in her hand but there was at first a lot of shrugged shoulders Then Sasha clarified matters decisively Thats the Virgin Mary My Nana told me all about her I asked Oh I wonder what kind of book the Virgin Mary would be reading She thought then replied Probably a book of prayers This I thought was a special insight one that was really not too far off the mark Often solitary female figures in paintings from the middle ages turn out to be the Madonna and while Im not knowledgeable about Catholic saints this one sounds like shes right up there near the top of the hierarchy

This all started when Princess Birgitta borrowed the Cameo Tiara from her mother Princess Sibylla for her wedding day Actually she had a twotiara affair she wore this for her civil ceremony and a tiara from her husbands family the Hohenzollerns for the religious wedding Its a bit of an unusual wedding pick due to its interesting form and color but it is one of the most historically significant pieces the Swedish house owns Her sister Princess D√sir√e followed in her footsteps but their other two sisters chose different headpieces The strength of this budding tradition in my opinion comes from their sisterinlaw Queen Silvia and her decision to wear this on her wedding day Weve now seen it on Crown Princess Victoria and its a safe bet that well see it on Princess Madeleine some day
Okay I admit it The post before this one was a smoke screen a weak attempt to convince myself that my relationship with Facebook was more akin to a giddy coffee date than a gluttonous multiday orgy but orgy it was I don‚Äôt actually linger there like a neer do well barfly but do check in possibly times a day for a quick fix a social bump if you will In my opinion that‚Äôs overcommitment when there are other more important activities to be done‚Älike blogging ‚ÄúDear mom I‚Äôm so sorry I made you look at that picture of those green cupcakes for so many days‚Äù So I‚Äôm solemnly swearing to fewer daily voyeuristic activities on Facebook and more engagement with the family the pet and the world around me in real time I can do it I can do it I can do it

Why would we take our commitments to this group so seriously I can only speak for myself when I say that these gatherings have made me a better human being The more I participate in our group meetings the more I learn about myself and the more I can understand just a little of what others see as they practice in their spiritual traditions I find the many ways that we are alike and the few ways in which we see the world differently I do my best to set aside judgment while noticing that these friends are doing the same for me

 Super Friends First aired ran until The Super Friends were an animated group of superhero comrades The show was based on the Justice League of Americaa fictional superhero team that appeared in thenrecent comic books During its year span the show existed under several different titles all involving some combination including the words super and friends Plotlines for the show focused on the often farfetched schemes of mad scientists and aliens who were eventually revealed to be wellintentioned but pursuing their goals through unlawful means Typically each episode would end with the Super Friends convincing the antagonsits to adopt more reasonable methods The Super Friends and the Justice League of America were merely the animated embodiment of the justice for all atmosphere that cloaked the nation at that time

‚ÄòYou can have this all‚Äô he whispered as he clutched her driving his ambition and anger and wisdom into her entire being His mind melded into hers and she saw an empyreal heaven above and black tartareous dregs below She all at once knew that the world was made of base embryonic atoms and she knew that she was a material being and she knew that she had no soul She could never have a soul She was the atoms clashing amongst themselves in the tumult of her entwined intercourse with the wisest of all beings She saw that her body and mind were thus limited she could never hope to achieve greatness because she was physically not made for greatness She was only made for a piffling mediocrity This would not do
More problems for Joan and Frank DAmico Jr and their wonderful oldfashioned Carroll Gardens coffee and specialty food store at Court Street You may remember that in early February Joan taped a note on the stores window addressing the persons who made an anonymous complaint to about the smell of roasting coffee which wafts from the store when the coffee roaster is in use

The conversation should be about informing and persuading and yet all it ever seems to be about is belittling and berating It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you believe only in the numbers or think it‚Äôs all hogwash do people still use that word Why would anyone want to listen to what you have to say if you‚Äôre starting your argument with some variation of ‚Äúhere is why you are stupid‚Äù Why would anyone want to talk to you if all you are going to do is scoff at them And what is the point of discussing hockey or anything else only with people who think exactly like you and don‚Äôt have any other points of view Why is it always about how wrong someone is and not about respectfully showing them how you came to your conclusion instead

Remember the first disappointment the first heartache and how deep it‚Äôs carved in your heart
However Im dont want to get into the manipulation and sickening use of the attack for political purposes instead I think its important to remember that there were nearly people that were killed and that those people were innocently murdered for the sake of a radical religiopolitical ideology whose aim it was to strike fear into our hearts and disrupt our way of living The people who were killed were fathers and mother sisters and brothers sons and daughters grandparents aunts uncles cousins friends Many thousands of people that were nowhere near the World Trade Center The Pentagon or the field outside of Shanksville PA were affected by losing someone they loved The ability to deal with and move on from this tragedy has been different for everyone and some people grieve best by getting revenge Some people grieve by withdrawing and closing themselves off to the outside world until theyve had time to figure things out for themselves Some people go on with their lives as if nothing has changed constantly trying to not remember the horrific events theyve witnessed or the loved ones theyve lost Others simply weep at the unimaginable destruction that was wrought both to the planes and the buildings that were crashed into but also in the hearts of people who cannot comprehend what would compel someone to do something so awful to others The truth is that there is no comprehension of how people can come up with plan and execute such a ghastly endeavor but I guess our goal should not be to comprehend but to feel sympathy not only for ourselves but also for those that harbor so much hatred and anger within themselves

I also noticed that Filipino men are not under the same pressure to become white Commercials don‚Äôt really make them feel like they need to have a rosy white glow or to have a secret beauty transformation I guess it‚Äôs also because men are not under the same pressure to be beautiful There‚Äôs the pressure to go to the gym and get muscles or to use Master sikreto ng mga gwapo but if we compare that to the pressure to invest in makeup whitening creams dresses or skirt and blouse or pants and blouse or tank top and jeans and the like belts jewelry high heeledshoes bags eyebrow plucking leg waxing hairrebonding weekly manicures and pedicures‚Äîit is obvious that the pressure to be beautiful is heavier on women Some may say that it‚Äôs the women who actually like doing this so no one‚Äôs really pressuring women to be beautiful I disagree Although it is true that some women are genuinely interested in these things others don‚Äôt want to go through all that hassle but they hear it from their friends their own mothers their aunts that they‚Äôll never have a boyfriend if they don‚Äôt do this

The Commonwealth has no direct head of legislative power with respect to the print media However the Commonwealth may nonetheless regulate the print media by virtue of indirect heads of power such as those relating to trade and commerce taxation corporations external affairs and the Territories The most significant of these is the corporations power ‚Äì its potential application to news media regulation is expanded on below In addition the Commonwealth may regulate print media where doing so is incidental to the exercise of a direct head of power ‚Äì for example it can limit ownership and control of print media as a condition of radio and television broadcasting licenses issued by virtue of section v

As I‚Äôve gotten older I have started to understand the temptations of food a little more but not to the extremes that some people take it I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever listened to The Splendid Table but that woman talks about food like a registered sex offender talks about sixteen year olds I once had a child in my car and they heard her talking about an egg she ate in France and I had to turn off the radio because I worried that it was doing psychological damage She once had a twenty minute conversation with someone about the impact different types of bread have had on her life While undoubtedly important I rarely ever reflect back on the breads in my life when I‚Äôm not already eating a piece It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous The food television networks are better but I‚Äôll still occasionally get the impression that the food is supposed to deliver some sort of higher pleasure to the person consuming it than it should It‚Äôs usually when they strategically light the food to look good and then shoot it with a soft filter like it‚Äôs in some sex scene on an vintage soap opera that I‚Äôll start to feel like something is amiss

 In this case there are no elements which indicate that in English the expression ‚Äòcargo partner‚Äô has in common parlance a meaning other than that of presenting the partner offering services of transport packaging and storage of goods In relation to the terms which compose it the sign CARGO PARTNER does not present any additional characteristic capable of making the sign as a whole appropriate to distinguish the services of the applicant from those of other undertakings in the mind of the relevant public

I don‚Äôt know what the future is going to look like for South Africans There will be change With countries like America becoming socialist they will no longer be able to preserve the world order As much as that may seem like a good thing for South Africa there may not be other nations or cultures willing to take up the fight for human rights again like western civilizations did We know China does not have a good track record with human rights And as the global economy collapses my fight for survival is just as intense as the next guy‚Äôs Faced with the prospect of an unnatural death I don‚Äôt believe it is very admirable to surrender my soul to hysteria caused by self ‚Äì doubt in war time

After work a man asked what the call of God on my life is Wow How does one respond to a question like that to a stranger and honestly So honestly I let my mouth walk in faith by speaking what my heart knew I told him that I would be at the forefront of a movement being called ‚ÄúThe Third Great Awakening‚Äù My fellow workers eyes teared up with muddy puddles of salt and water He appeared to be shaking not out of fear but out of complete brokeness His bottom lip quivered and his heavy eyes pointed at me while his head still faced the ground A raspy and contrite tone came from him saying ‚ÄúI have been praying for that for years and years and years‚Äù

I‚Äôve started emailing the way I blog only this time it‚Äôs a bit more extreme I typically write about a day or two in advance I write a lot of half posts too Those posts I finish a day or two before they post My point is I sit on a lot of stuff It‚Äôs very rare that something gets published the same day it‚Äôs written and I think I‚Äôve only posted once within an hour of writing I‚Äôm committed to blogging everyday just not most Sundays It‚Äôs something that I did as a challenge to myself and it morphed into something else And while I‚Äôm not nearly at the level of some of my fellow bloggers check out my blogroll by the way I still want to write my posts in a clear and concise way that‚Äôs easy to follow which rarely happens but I try And that usually means that I have to read them over before I publish to clarify or fix errors though I‚Äôm far from perfect when it comes to that stuff And I‚Äôve noticed over the past year that sometimes when I go back a day later it‚Äôs not quite right Or I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking when I wrote it Or something doesn‚Äôt fit and would do better on its own So that‚Äôs my method And I think it would be a good idea to apply to emails

From the th century St Marys was the base for the growth of a local type of administration the select vestry of St Marys Parish Church known as the fourandtwenty As its name suggests this select vestry comprised twenty four of the leading inhabitants of Gateshead They were selfcoopting not elected by the parishioners and they effectively controlled those aspects of local government for example the care of the poor and the maintenance of the highways which government legislation had made a parish responsibility The minute books of the fourandtwenty survive from when the body was already well established

Im not as familiar with Gottfried but I know Auster follows European politics almost as closely as he follows domestic American politics His main concern isnt religion Its antisemitism If he gets the slightest whiff that a person or organization opposes jewish interests explicitly or not it doesnt matter whether they are good Christians dislike muslims or agree with him on every other point of his projewish worldviewThere might well be problems with the liberal ideas that Jews have supported until now but it is simply wrong to pretend that Jewish liberals act from liberal motives that have nothing to do with their Jewish fears and hostilities Ive never met a Jewish liberal whose leftist politics was not in some way connected to his selfidentity as a JewAuster only poses as an antiliberal conservative His preoccupation is with defending jewish interests His opposition to immigration into the West is based primarily on it being bad for jews His dissembling about liberalism and judeoChristian heritage is only part of his deliberate and more general conflation of White and jewish interests Gottfried likewise but less blatantly poses as a conservative against liberalism Together he and his friend Auster demonstrate that selfidentity as a jew is not only connected to liberals and leftist politics

Some mothers of babies with clefts have commented that their children didnt start eating great until after their cleft repairs but since Maddys cleft repair will be delayed until she is about two years old we need to learn to work with it I dont want her eating purees until shes two The occupational therapist suggested getting a palatal obturator made to close the cleft so she can eat without food going into the nasal cavity so we have a referral to dentist for that
Having said all of this my conclusion is that precedent was set with the very institution of the Wild Card rule and that the rule that is currently in effect has absolutely NOTHING to do with setting one‚Äôs ‚Äúqualification‚Äù for Worlds Therefore my conclusion is that USATF should simply disband the rule altogether as it really serves no useful purpose And Merritt or any other athlete should be the Wild Card pass that they earned when they finished first in the previous World Championships

This is a really stupid movie but I have always enjoyed it and it still makes me laugh It is pretty similar to Road Trip which came out four years prior I think this movie does just enough to set itself apart and make it memorable for me anyways I know a guy from high school who looks exactly like Matt Damon in this movie and he is the lead singer of a band now I love that song he sings ‚ÄúScotty doesn‚Äôt know‚Äù it stays with me for days Otherwise there isn‚Äôt much more worth mentioning here mediocre cast in the leading roles with the support of several big names in cameos Aside from Damon Lucy Lawless Vinnie Jones Fred Armisen Diedrich Bader and the incredibly funny Jeffrey Tambor appear in cameo roles They all came together for this movie and were very funny In the lead cast Jacob Pitts was exceptionally funny and I will always remember him from this movie The others were funny as well but have done little else with their careers This is a quick and pointless movie so if you know that going in I think it is worth your time It‚Äôs a funny movie that I always enjoy seeing but nevertheless it doesn‚Äôt deserve much more than this as far as a review goes
I loved the story in this novel and thought it was a very unique spin on Jane Austen‚Äôs tale I love historical fiction and it was intriguing reading about Napoleon and the infamous Battle of Waterloo as fought by Austen‚Äôs beloved characters I loved how so many of my favorite characters returned including Fitzwilliam and Elizabeth Darcy the Bingleys the Collins etc I also like how Caroline Bingley was given a great depth and an ability to redeem herself Anne de Bourgh is also fleshed out and given a great depth Napoleon is not the only villain in this novel with appearances from Lady Catherine de Bourgh Mr Wickham and Willoughby If I had to face Napoleon or Lady Catherine I‚Äôm not sure which would be the safer route

My son is in a new school this year he was home schooled before and the big challenge now is to find friends He has no friends yet and I just feel so sorry for him I still remember my elementary school years where I was mobbed for being fatter as all the other children Im praying that God would have grace on him and give him at least ONE friend in the coming weeks

I say this as a concerned parent who sadly has lost his own two young ones to Marmite I married a Marmite lover I admit it I thought she would keep her Marmite love to herself but she INDOCTRINATED them into loving Marmite when they were very small and impressionable How evil is that feeding Marmite to defenceless babies Now its too late But it made me realise that Marmite lovers arent that different from me afterall I know my kids theyre just like everyone elses kids though by far more talented and pretty and all that and they sure tidy their rooms in the morning Not
I took my last hiatus because I had a child I have now returned to working as a veterinary technician at a new clinic It is in a small town so it is no real surprise that I have already run into many of the clients outside of the clinic Most of the euthanasias are with the owner present Today it was my childs pediatricians dog She was there with her husband and her children and they spent a significant amount of time explaining everything to the kids They were thoughtful and gentle and her eldest son held the dogs head as the solution was injected Before it was all in he said shes gone mama Everyone in the room was tearful including me I excused myself silently and wondered to myself if she would mention today at our babys next appointment which is in two weeks Their family was beautiful
But it was not just a night of CD promotion though I heard there might have been CDs available at the bar George touched the heart with beautiful ballads that wrenched at the soul He performed a more traditional version of ‚ÄúCaledonia‚Äù which was so beautiful that I spent most of it in tears ‚ÄúOrdinary Man‚Äù established George as an everyman‚Äôs folk singer in a song that was both passionate and powerful In fact it was George‚Äôs passion throughout the entire night that had me so taken and wishing that we could get more of this in Celtic Thunder shows It wasn‚Äôt just this one song‚Ä it was the entire setlist George infused every song with so much emotion alternating from passion to tenderness sometimes so quickly and effortlessly that I hadn‚Äôt even realized that he had done it It was the passion that made you really feel the stories being told

The other thing that had me wondering some was the wheel choice Fulcrum part of Campagnolo makes a fine hoop but their base level wheel on a noholdsbarred race bike is somewhat troubling Again I suspect I know why this is done‚Äîto control costs and running on the theory that most folks getting this bike have or will get their preferred race wheels That makes some sense on the highest end bikes But a racer looking to get a race bike out of the box would be better served with a nicer wheelset The stock Fulcrum whoops are decidedly unaero and quite heavy when compared with other even entrylevel race wheels Noticeably pictures of the S bikes on Cervelo‚Äôs website show different wheels on the bikes

The Moth is a nonprofit organisation that brings real life stories to audiences that would otherwise never hear them Writers comedians and every day people are invited to hone their craft of storytelling and share them without notes to a live audience My first exposure to the Moth was through the weekly podcast series which can be downloaded from iTunes every Monday not that I‚Äôm not commission Yet I was captivated instantly by the immediacy of the stories I heard despite the fact that these people being half way around the world and from completely different lives and backgrounds I felt I could relate to them The Moth‚Äôs stories are moving inspiring informative often challenging and above all entertaining Sometimes hysterically so There‚Äôs a great power in what the organisation does giving a voice to individuals who may never have the opportunity to speak out in this way

I do not rejoice that I am lucky enough to posses while billion people live below the poverty line instead this figure is like a lingering symbol of the realisation that I am painfully trapped under the support of my parents That I am hopelessly cripplingly broke And on top of this how the hell do you even get cent in your bank account in the first place How ridiculous It‚Äôs like the money is mocking me with the obviously unattainable cent in our cent limited monetary system It‚Äôs whispering to me in my dreams that even the embarrassingly tiny figure in my account has to be rounded down

I‚Äôm more upset like everyone else to see my Shepard‚Äôs love interest and presumably my squad member somehow back on the Normandy when they were both with Shepard in the final battle on Earth Seriously why is Kaidan on the ship with Joker and not with my Shepard How the hell did Joker somehow manage to pick up my squad but leave my Shepard behind Why is Kaidan smiling as he assesses the new world I can go on with the endless amount of questions the player is left with but then I‚Äôd be venturing back into spoiler territory It really is out of character to witness Joker chickening out in battle and leave and find time to pick up my squad but not care about his commanding officer That‚Äôs highly unlikely And Kaidan Come on The guy literally told my Shepard how he can‚Äôt lose her again right before the final battle on Earth and I believe not being at my Shepard‚Äôs side until the very end is very out of character for Kaidan Unless Shepard at some point radioed Joker told him to pick up Kaidan and Garrus because things are getting dangerous and leave her behind I could imagine Kaidan fighting Shepard on this but somehow manages to get Kaidan on the ship anyway So if it were to play out like that Kaidan emerging from the ship with a smile on his face hardly makes sense The man would be wringing his hands in fear for the woman he left behind He‚Äôd yell at Joker for leaving Shepard on Earth Hell the guy would tear up the rest of the crashed Normandy‚Äôs ship interior in rage for being on some random planet and not with the woman he loves But smiling Hell no Kaidan would not be smiling at all Unless I want to believe Kaidan went jerk on my Shepard in the last to minutes of the game but I really doubt this is the case at all

Nearly three years ago my father had a pretty bad stroke Certain circumstances were already in place that made the overall situation a little easier to handle from a family standpoint Unfortunately Dad had his stroke at that strange hour of am He awoke again later took his daily meds and started to go about his day He considered he‚Äôd possibly taken a double dose of his meds because he felt strangely sluggish and uncoordinated dribbling water when he drank from a bottle On a business trip luckily he was with people who had known him for years‚Äand knew the telltale signs of a stroke EMTs were contacted and he was rushed to a hospital Much too late to use clotbusting drugs The stroke progressed over the next day or so robbing my father of mobility flexibility dexterity dignity and we feared almost his life

So how would you go from chair to k in a mere a few weeks period How will you get yourself started a k program if you‚Äôve by no means trained before given that your level of fitness is really low and if you possibly even overweight Well it‚Äôs not too hard the simple truth is because it just takes easing to the k exercise program in order that you raise your level of training and endurance little by little and with virtually no strain on the body One thing you have to keep in mind if you‚Äôve never ever done any training before is your targets have to be reasonable

When children are in school all day mostly sitting and being controlled and not being provided with opportunities for authentic engagement that means doing things they find interesting that relate to their lives and that they have a purpose for learning they get home and they need to decompress and use those hours to do what they enjoy and that they cant do at school Often this involves technology and screens of some sort Of course there are those kids who are scheduled and controlled for every waking house but that will have to wait for another blog post Kids have no problem paying attention to media or a book or any activity they choose and enjoy because of intrinsic motivation If they arent paying attention in school its generally because they arent engaged they find the school environment inhospitable or they are coping with the social challenges of school including bullying If we really want to improve childrens wellbeing as the official site says we would take children out of the institutional setting of school and create opportunities for learning that are fun and innovative instead of pretending that making kids turn off media for a week is a fun and innovative opportunity

Ill be blunt here if you expect your child to feel grateful to you for adopting him or her then you are being boastful Because you are in effect secretly saying look at this great thing I did Dont go there And dont allow others to go there either Instead you need to express with all humility how much you have gained through adoption at the expense of so many others including your child That is not to say that we should not train our children to possess an overall attitude of gratitude rather than a sense of entitlement But thats a whole nother topic

Her words were comforting Like Foer‚Äôs friend who finds it harder and harder to sleep at night and yet finds more and more meaning in her days there is a cost for being hungry being exhausting being changed but unchanging It is a restless way to live but it is the most rewarding for ourselves and our world as long as our restlessness provokes action sparks conversations creates an opening for something new and needed to be born into the world

These are all amazing novels with magic being central to the plot and Brandon Sanderson has developed rich worlds and strict magic systems that function almost more as science than magic The rules of magic are usually clearly stated and defined and understood and then followed In his podcast Writing Excuses in which he and other writers talk about different aspects of writing he has come up with Sanderson‚Äôs First Law ‚ÄúAn author‚Äôs ability to solve conflict satisfactorily with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic‚Äù If the magic is clearly defined then it can be used to solve problems and the reader is okay with it if though the magic is not clearly understood when it is used to solve problems it appears more as a deus ex machina

The First Wire NYC Team
 Consider There Might Be Something Wrong
Since the New York Yankees have had one prospect that seemingly every team in the league wanted to get their hands on That prospect was none other than CatcherDH Jesus Montero who ironically was considered by some of the Yankee‚Äôs ownership as the savior of the organization Montero who is only years old has already shown that he is a monster with a bat in his hand In only games last season the Phenom had HR‚Äôs RBI‚Äôs and a BAA of In most of these games he played as a DH instead of behind the plate What the Yankees had in hitting they lacked in their pitching staff Because of their poor pitching GM Brian Cashman felt that it was a necessity for the team to add at least more arms to its starting rotation So on January th in a trade with the Seattle Mariners the Yankees parted ways with their coveted prospect in exchange for a young yearold SP by the name of Michael Pineda Pineda like Montero had been the prized possession in the Seattle farm system standing at a towering ‚Äô ‚Äù Pineda can reach speeds upwards of mph on the radar gun and features a slider that breaks in hard on Left Handed batters Along with the acquiring of Pineda the team also sign RHP Hiroki Kuroda who spent the season in LA with the Dodgers The yearold Kuroda is a native of Japan and has been in the majors for seasons Kuroda is not a pitcher that will over power hitters like Pineda will but will instead use strategy and movement with his pitches to fool hitters His numbers weren‚Äôt too shabby with a career ERA of was not an awful year by any means for Kuroda With a record and an ERA of Hiroki should really benefit from the Yankees offense that is much stronger and more reliable than the bats in LA

Now to the physics Newton‚Äôs Third law tells us that every force comes with a reaction force which has the same size as the original force but acts in the opposite direction When you‚Äôre sitting on a chair for example you are pushing the chair downwards and in turn the chair is pushing you back up allowing you to hopefully sit comfortably without falling down If you drop a stone into water similarly the stone pushes down on the water and the water pushes the stone back up or in other words gives a ‚Äúlift‚Äù to the stone However there is another force‚Äîgravity that‚Äôs trying to pull the stone right down If the lift trying to push the stone up is not as strong as the force of gravity pulling the stone down the stone‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîfalls down

We bought the house from a dentist and his partner who was somebody well known in jurisprudence I‚Äôm not even sure I know what that means Anyhow neither seemed the sort of guy who would go in for yoga or meditation or any of these Eastern practices which we in the West treat with such reverence as being superior ways to understand the world ourselves and the part we play in it Sitting crosslegged for hours at a time and saying OMMMMMMM deep down every couple of seconds or so never seemed to me the surest way of dealing with life‚Äôs pesky problems
The rating system for the two movies was problematic The foul language of a griefstricken child in Descendants was essential to characterization and garnered the movie an R This means that the young viewers who could have really benefited from an art form that handled bereavement with such honesty will likely not see the movie since parents are unlikely to allow children to see an Rrated movie even in the posttheater rental environment

When grown for fibre flax is harvested after the pale blue flowers have fallen but before the seed ripens and because it is the stalk that is being harvested it is not cut but pulled up by the roots The beets sheaves are carried as soon as possible to be steeped drowned or dubbed in the flax dam or lint hole where soft peaty water has been standing for some days to warm up The process of retting rotting takes from seven to twelve days and is soon advertised by a foul and penetrating odour as the core or bone of the stalk decays

Negative remarks aside I am really enjoying my box In terms of value youre definitely getting your moneys worth those really are deluxesize samples no little foil packets or other such nonsense Also all the brands are of the highend spectrum Dermalogica Fekkai REN Oscar de la Renta and Skyn Iceland which is a brand Ive never heard about before Actually the Skyn Iceland Icelandic Relief Eye Pen is a full size product the only difference from regular retail being that this was unboxed So far Ive tried the eye pen which is great I might do a separate review and the Fekkai Glossing Cream which I quite like as well I like that there is such a good variety of brands and products skin hair perfume I was secretly wishing for a makeup item in there but maybe next month If I was really splitting hairs Id say that two exfoliating products is a bit much but then the REN is more like a mask so thats ok

At first this seemed like a disaster But it gave the nurse an opportunity to remember me and my history and to suggest that we reorganise the test with the help of one of the consultants so that I could have privacy during it and senior medical supervision to reassure me Whilst I was not overly concerned about making a fool of myself because I know my panic attacks aren‚Äôt my fault and aren‚Äôt anything to be ashamed of I was worried at the prospect of upsetting the other patients And I definitely felt much better about having the test with a consultant present rather than a junior doctor So although it was a little annoying to have wasted fuel and time and effort getting to the hospital and all to no avail I do feel that perhaps things have worked out as they should have done even if this will mean a further delay
This recording session involving leaders Pandelis Karayorgis and Mat Maneri along with their supporting cast Tony Malaby Michael Formanek and Randy Peterson all musicians they had both worked with before was put together hastily It falls to the jazzmens credit that Disambiguation sounds so unforced and rehearsed and flows so naturally The pianist and violist know each other well enough to share a level of comfort that often finds improv musicians turning lazy and remaining on previously charted ground If this quintet doesnt explore new cuttingedge territories it sure cant be accused of laziness Karayorgis came up with five loose compositions heads and subgroup sequences a basspiano duet here a trio section there etc The group members made the music their own rather than learned it and recorded it as if they had been playing it for years Nothing here stands out of the ordinary the pianists tumbling lines Maneris deep viola lines the rhythm section playing in and out often at the same time Detractors of free jazz will say that this has been done before and so forth But these five players do it well more than that they do it casually Unpretentiously like it is their everyday bread and butter they pour their hearts and souls into Karayorgis postbop themes that Monk signature again in the opening theme of Three Plus Three break down their sound into every possible combination of players to show everything they can do and bring it softly Home in the end All in a days work right Disambiguation is the work of professionals still thrilled by what they do

In the final part of this series the concept of cloud storage will be explored further Cloud storage simply put is the concept of storing information in secure locations online rather than on a hard disk on a PC laptop or server This has obvious benefits to both businesses and home users not least enabling data backup and sharing as well as device synchronising Gladinet and iCloud By utilising clustering and load balancing technologies these solutions offer a much reduced risk to data loss through hardware failure Furthermore cloud storage is incredibly flexible and responsive to actual needs Where traditionally a business would have to purchase a SAN or server in smaller cases capable of not only supporting the existing needs but also the expected growth in needs over the SAN server‚Äôs lifespan cloud storage allows business to rapidly increase their storage capacity and thus reduce wasted expenditure

The judge came in and the proceedings began One side spoke and then the other Her therapist gave her a glowing recommendation This wasn‚Äôt a custody hearing as they lived together with the children fairly happily through the rest of the year This had to do with the past A past from before they were married From before she was old enough to read or go to school But it would not go away The court system wouldn‚Äôt let it So they were back again this year also Each year it was discussed and gone over until someone always said that it shouldn‚Äôt have come this far in the first place but that never changed a thing

And most of all it makes fun of the audience for their perverse need to watch the stupid movies that the horror genre has become From the obsessive need to see naked women which is hit both with seeing all the technicians crowded into the control room to get a glimpse and again with Hadley‚Äôs enthusiastic ‚Äúscore‚Äù‚Äto the fact that the audience of this genre is constantly being mocked for believing such preposterous situations‚Äand in the final dig for comparing the audience to absolute evil for it‚Äôs insatiable need to see such suffering offered up to us as if it was a sacrifice that we demand The film closes with a not too subtle call for the audience of this genre to rise up and demand that this cycle of crappy movie end once and for all as they don‚Äôt provide anything

About the title of this postyesterday my scheduled workout was High Tight and Tummy Tuck Well I did Tummy Tuck then popped in the other DVD that High Tight is on And my computer is stupid and refused to recognize the DVD WTF I dont know whats wrong but my TV is also on the fritz right now getting that checked out tonight so I didnt have a way to play the other part of my workout I was really frustrated but then remembered that there were these cards that came with the program that have exercise moves on them When I saw them I remember thinking When am I ever gonna use these but they actually really came in handy because there were different moves all from the various workouts and it told me how many reps to do of each move So I turned on some Enrique Iglesias music oh yeah and did two circuits of the moves It wasnt the same as doing the DVD but it was about the same length of time my legs and butt felt it and I sweated so I figure good enough Ill be damned if Im gonna let my stupid electronics make me miss a workout So the next time youre facing something that might cause you to miss your workout just figure out a way to make it work If you wake up late fit it in later that night If the weathers bad and you usually do stuff outside go to the gym or do an exercise DVD If your DVD player stops working do what you remember or just find another routine you can do without a DVD Theres always a way that you can make sure youre getting exercise in your day Dont let convenient excuses ruin that for you

If the movie had this effect on me it must be devastating for parents I can‚Äôt imagine what it feels like for a mother or for anyone for that matter to watch a psychopath in the making ‚Äì all those signs no matter what anyone does or says It seems that it cannot be stopped Kevin‚Äôs eyes ‚Äìthroughout all the different ages ‚Äì creeped me out A human being without feelings someone who is capable of being so mean During those two hours I caught myself holding my breath dozens of times all that noise all that red ‚Äì it makes you uncomfortable suffocated You feel the mother‚Äôs desperation and fear the father being such an idiot makes you angry The minute I saw the little girl with a patch over her eye I knew her brother had had something to do with it ‚Äì the more you see of him the more evil you expect As the film goes one in a nonlinear way Eva‚Äôs feelings ‚Äì of course her name would have to be Eva ‚Äì became my feelings all the guilt she carries with her The brief dialogue and the hug in the final scene felt like a punch in the stomach I don‚Äôt like to play the gender card but in this case I strongly believe that being directed by a woman made this movie what it is ‚Äì looking forward to seeing more of Lynne Ramsay‚Äôs work to me she deserved the nomination more than Alexander Payne or Woody Allen this year

The Bill also makes an unneccesary distinction between procedural and substantive unfair contract terms It fails to make provision as to what types of contracts exactly are covered by the Part and extending the application to ‚Äúall‚Äù contracts could possibly have unexpected and unfavourable ramifications It crucially also fails to address the issue of application taking into account where the contract is concluded ie whether in or outside Malaysia or what happens when a contract applies foreign law A test for determining what amounts to ‚Äúwithout adaquate justifiaction‚Äù is absent as well as a list of examples of unfair contract terms What offence created is not clearly defined and the potential effects not carefully studied

This book also has more than its share of plot twists I would go so far as to say that this one is the most twisted of all the Demon Squad books While previous books did have the twists none of them were so caustic as these to Frank After all the recent deaths in the previous two books the author does continue the trend not in number but in terms of important personage I was very much surprised by the turns of the plot as the author constantly kept on switching tracks and thereby made the ending that much more unpredictable Characterizationwise this book is the most accomplished of all however it focuses solely on Frank With these books Frank has always been the sole narrator but with the last two books the focus was widened on the side character cast however with this one the scope is again narrowed down to Frank This kind of narrative while having its plus points also makes it a problem if the reader doesn‚Äôt connect with the story However with Frank the reader is always left stunned with the amount and importance of information revealed and this just makes the next book that much more enticing especially when Frank reunites with those that have wronged him

We do sometimes use a version of timeout in conjunction with sitting knee to knee if either my husband or I feel that there is a need but not to be punitive as much as giving them a chance to be apart from each other and a chance to calm down regroup and reflect before sitting knee to knee They are supposed to use the time to do some thinking which also in most cases includes a few seconds where they ask God to help them As a family we believe in the Golden Rule so if they have done something that is not in line with this we want them to reflect on this to ask God for help

The corruption in many of the elite levels of the upper ranks of the Civil Service personnel have the same track record except they simply held government jobs moving up regularly and eventually they are at what I call the convention level This is the level that invents reasons to hold training sessions or hold a convention for some legal sounding excuse and it is almost always held in Las Vegas Hawaii Bermuda or other vacation Mecca possibly even the French Riviera if your GS Level is at a minimum of twelve Such is more often an interdepartment event where almost everybody is a GS or higher These are the true professional people whose ability to make expenditures is of the highest orders and quite beyond the imagination of mere mortal taxpayers These are government employees who have government provided chauffeurs driving them around in a Lincoln Cadillac or even a Mercedes By the time you get to the highest level of our Federal government you have been rewarded and rated as exemplary at your job for so many years and for levels of work that are often the butt of jokes for comedians performing in the Nation‚Äôs Capital Actually after having been raised in the suburbs of our Nation‚Äôs capital I am surprised that there are not far more instances of such extravagant and overthetop malfeasance by our highest level miscreants sorry government employees The sorry thing is many actually do attempt to work diligently and competently but the ones who are along for the ride give the whole a bad name The only thing I can recommend we the tax paying public can do is to thank those who work in the government at any level when they treat their job and the public they serve with respect and show diligence Complaining about the others will usually not accomplish anything except supply the watercooler circle with grist for their comedic mills

Ideas alone cannot have any effect They are simply information and evil people know this That is why conditions are set up in the physical world to empower those ideas and hence trick the other person into believing them And let me specify here again that empowered ideas are not ones that the evil people can present as some potent weapon being thrown at the victim from them Evil people have no mental powers Empowered ideas only means that lame ideas are presented at such time and in such a way as to find fertile soil The victim is upholding beliefs together with changes to their body function which occur simultaneously with the ideas presented so as to make those ideas appear as powerful ideas They are not It is all about deceit and really a dramatic puppet show stitched together a cut and paste exercise With this in mind we can then appreciate that to generate barrier or resistance cells in the body what doctors call cancer cells there needs to be harmful ideas presented in the mind that are empowered because of the condition of the targeted person the victim and for all that to occur when the targeted person is angry and hostile When a person is angry and hostile they will hold a misguided volition with respect to those ideas as to struggle with them However finding no clear and definable aggressor with which to struggle which is their plan A they go to plan B In Plan B their volition becomes the desire to build a barrier or shield for protection against the mysterious aggressor The theatre of war seems to be in the body so the barrier that can be built can only ever be a cell barrier which of course grow bigger and bigger the harder they struggle and fight until a mass is formed This mass doctors call cancer

In terms of my artistic formation the last couple of years have involved learning to take risks artistically by recognizing that the alternative the hip disinterested and neutral approach only stifles artistic expression and relational growth The illusion of deep selfawareness does little to elicit creativity and even less to bring about authentic relationships I have learned that I am a Songwriter cue triumphant selfrevelatory music Processing life through song is how I was made to function Does my work have to be received well by all in order to be perceived as legitimate Is that even possible Writing music is part of a healthy cycle of reflection for me I learn I internalize I process I write a song and I share it with someone It‚Äôs usually my husband Joe my children who are so annoyed that I am holding my guitar instead of playing with them that it‚Äôs counterproductive ‚Äúlisten to mommy‚Äôs new song dang it‚Äù a friend or an audience at a show It‚Äôs a relational process as much as an artistic process We risk relationally when we risk artistically We take something we have created and offer it along with a part of ourselves to the audience hearer viewer or reader The response of the audience member is important but it does not contain the power to legitimize an individual‚Äôs artistic endeavor It‚Äôs in us and we either ignore it whatever the reason may be and feel the negative effects on our souls or embody it and come more fully into who we were made to be Having been formed by a Divine Artist to function in very specific ways we have the freedom along with the responsibility to explore and lean into who we were made to be This is for the betterment of ourselves the fuller and more complete expression of corporate living and ultimately for the glory of our Maker who has formed us to be cocreators with Him So go forth and risk Then tell me about it and I will write you a song because that is what I do

When we take a look at what went on in our childhood how we felt in relationship to each of our parents we can see the early seeds for what drives our unconscious choices that created our current life For example we may have felt abandoned by our mother so we tend to recreate unconsciously situations in which we do not feel supported or nurtured Maybe we felt aggressed by our father so we tend to attract work or society situations that are dissonant with who we are or even abusive Or maybe we just feel unwelcome in our work environment and become an overachiever or workaholic Every person again will be entirely unique

Nobel prize winning JM Coetze in his essay on translating Kafka argues that the way his original translators viewed his work colored the choices they made when translating The first translators saw his body of work in religious terms and thus made translation decisions that reflected and in many instances amplified this approach These decisions in turn colored subsequent translators as well as critics and readers The same thing can be said for Brod and for the Kafka papers Some see Brod as a savior Others see him as an opportunist Perhaps both are true Regardless Brod never made a firm decision concerning the archive ‚ÄúBrod always knew that he couldn‚Äôt hole on to Kafka forever‚Äù journalist Batuman writes ‚Äúbut he never really faced up to it and this is the result‚Äù

Wow I mean wow I wish this were uncommon but of course it isnt Somewhere along the way many parents have just gone crazy Why I dont know Maybe they are flying out to Omaha for a funeral Maybe they just lost their job or something difficult happened earlier in the day Could be because being a parent is hard Heck even though I never say these kinds of things I would be lying if I said I never felt them today is a great example It could be a thousand things I guess And if these were all isolated incidents if the parent who is only human after all caught themselves or apologized or gave a hug or something then maybe it would be easier for to understand and overlook But that rarely happens And after giving it some thought I think it comes down to expectations and entitlement

Detecting a hint of sarcasm in my remarks the manager blew a small raspberry and went off to play with his remotecontrolled Barbie doll Much as I abhor his crass opinions I find myself agreeing with him that this dispute does not belong in a courtroom Can any sum of money no matter how large ever compensate a woman for being forced to have an orgasm Even five million bucks would never wipe away the shame of being made to moan ecstatically while waves of toecurling rapture wash over her quivering body Once again it seems that a rapacious law firm has persuaded a woman to pursue litigation that will bring her no satisfaction in the long run

She led us back to the same exam room no less and got according to my expressed wishes my favorite nurse to come in with us I told them voice shaky and cracking that I wanted a running commentary as it happened The probe was in for about two seconds when she announced with not a small amount of relief on her part my husband and I both thought I see a flicker Which was very helpful to hear at that moment given that mine was about to explode right there on the exam table The sweetest relief ran through everything I could still feel She focused in on the heartbeat and measured beats per minute It was a little tough for me to see the screen and I can hardly remember what it looked like but it doesnt matter Its there and hopefully there will be many more opportunities to get a better look
Mustard based BBQ sauces were developed by German immigrants who came to the region in the th Century They were used to that type sauce back in Germany so they brought it with them Well everyone in that part of the country cooks a lot of pork I mean a lot of pork And those German immigrants combined their mustard sauces with the pulled pork and an amazing transformation occurred That smoke cooked pork already an amazing taste treat by itself moved up to an alternate plane of existence The bite of the mustard and the fruitiness of the apple cider vinegar combined to make an awesome sauce that made the pork shine like gold okay the yellow mustard accounts for the gold color but it still shines

Milan Petroviƒá As is the case with every other knowledge Internet has been of tremendous help in disseminating knowledge about Slavic pagan religion It‚Äôs fast and allows cheap Internet publishing to flourish thus making it possible for number of publications and papers to see the light of day which would be otherwise almost impossible Internet also has important purpose serving as the connecting media of choice through which Slavic and other pagans can learn and explore their and others religion and get in contact with other Slavic and other pagans The wonder of Internet made possible for virtual communities to form which in turn becomes real communities and groups of Slavic pagans The solitary Slavic pagans living abroad or in small towns or remote regions where it‚Äôs hard to find another that shares similar beliefs are enabled to be in contact via Internet with other Slavic pagans which might be even on another continent This improves their quality of life significantly I believe this process is common for every other pagan and neopagan religion

There are times when change‚Äîmoving to a new city or a new home or changing careers‚Äîis the right thing at the right time But there are also times when the urge for change is really just a desire to run away from problems that need to be faced rather than avoided These are the kinds of problems that recur in our lives For example issues with coworkers that seem to arise at every job we take or repeatedly getting into unhealthy relationships A move might temporarily distract us and even cure the problem for a time simply by taking us out of the situation in which the problem fully manifested itself However the problem will eventually appear again in our new situation

The main question from the media and indeed surrounding any analysis of occupy revealed in the tone of discourse on the subject is whether it is a legitimate grievance‚Äsix months of stay since September would show indicate that it is surely a genuine one Dyed in the wool capitalists dismissed the protestors as spoiled hippies who were wasting their time an understandable ploy ‚Äòpatting on the head‚Äô as I like to call it to condescend the youthful spirit of the movement Wikipedia at least tells me that ‚ÄòIn the richest of the American population owned of the country‚Äôs total wealth and the next owned ‚Äô It finally felt that the Country as well as many others was finally awaking to the reality of greed and may want to pursue policies of universal healthcare or fair taxes for the rich for example The biggest threat to the success and legitimacy of a movement like this was surely for it to be forgotten to turn stale

One way to get over the things in our lives that we are afraid of or to get better at things we don‚Äôt do well is to just do them more often If I pray continually theoretically my prayers will get better more effective and I will get more comfortable So I‚Äôm going to do that today When I was a brand new Christian a young woman told me one way to pray is ‚Äúup down in out‚Äù that is praise God confess your sin pray for yourself pray for others I know there are other devices that people use to pray one that comes to mind is ACTS‚Äìadoration confession thanksgiving supplication but I‚Äôm going to use this device for no particular reason

The mountain of Machu Picchu had been known about long before Hiram Bingham‚Äôs discovery but apart from a few local farmers and local historians no one was truly aware of what secrets were waiting to be found upon its high peak until the late th century After the abandonment of the city in the late th century upon the death of the Inca emperor Pachacuti whose estate Machu Picchu belonged to the site of high agricultural interest was using only for farming and was inhabited only by those who farmed on the surrounding land The estate of which Machu Picchu was part still had to be a tribute to the Spanish via the town of Ollantaytambo despite being the city now being abandoned and therefore still employed an official known as a ‚Äúcuraca‚Äù to carry out the necessary administrative tasks In the last known curaca of the city was Juan Macora who due to his forename of ‚ÄúJuan‚Äù must have been baptised as a Christian and possibly subject to some Spanish influence So it can be assumed that the Spanish were at least aware of the existence of the Machu Picchu district without being aware of it‚Äôs historic and cultural significance As long as they continued to receive the correct tribute they would have had no need to actually visit the district Numerous documents of the time refer to the site by various different names ‚ÄúPiocho‚Äù ‚ÄúPicho‚Äù ‚ÄúPiccho‚Äù ‚ÄúPicchu‚Äù but that may just be due to confusion over the exact spelling by officials unfamiliar with the Quechua language In May the Spanish corregidor Diego Rodriguez de Figueroa was sent to liaise with the rebel Inca leader Titu Casi at the bridge of Chuquichaca In the account of his journey there he mentioned that the Inca road which crossed the Vilcabamba river led to the settlements of ‚ÄúSapamarca Tambo and Picho‚Äù ‚ÄúTambo‚Äù refers to Ollantaytambo whereas ‚ÄúPicho‚Äù is though to refer to Machu Picchu

Theres even a correction to Rosenthals article stating that she originally said that Nigeria was only the size of New Mexico and Arizona The fact that she chose two and later three of the emptiest states in the country is telling In fairness the biggest states are the emptiest and to find some that add up to square miles with higher density would require more than the magic two or three But choosing Arizona and New Mexico creates an unnecessary contrast that can distort the emotional impact

Luke Kuechly has made a name for himself with his ability to tackle His production has been unmatched and he shows the ability to finish the job on a consistent basis He is not overly powerful and he‚Äôs not the type of player to lay the wood or stick players and stop them dead in their tracks Kuechly does a great job of breaking down in space playing with good pad level and overall form Staying square to his target Kuechly keeps his head up and does a good job of shooting his arms up through contact This allows Kuechly to consistently wrap up his ballcarrier and bring them to the turf Very rarely will you see Kuechly fail to make a tackle He is a sure as they come and while they might not be the most flashy hits in the world they are effective and even capable of jarring the ball loose from time to time

This beer is a cloudy golden beer in the style of a Belgian Strong Ale This Belgian beer does indeed smell of the hops But there‚Äôs something more to it To me this is strangely reminiscent of the Unibroue Fin Du Monde with the addition of a wheat beerlike smell Spice and citrus are in the scent like other wheat beers To me the putting hops on front street like that is a bit of a misnomer The hops are more used for the scent not taste There really isn‚Äôt a huge bitter note to the beer This beer has a very heavy mouthfeel to it and it is definitely a sipper of a beer Frank felt that this beer would be well paired with a sharp cheese We both noticed that while initially it was too sweet for our liking as the tasting continued and the beer warmed The scent too started to release its fragrant notes All in all this isn‚Äôt a beer I see myself seeking out but if you find you‚Äôre a fan of beers like Fin Du Monde or that style give it a try

This story has become even more convoluted First you see a picture of the US Ambassador Gary Locke walking Chen Guangcheng into a hospital Next news report is based on a Twitter account that states ‚ÄúMy biggest wish is to leave the country with my family and rest for a while‚Äù and that he remains concerned about the welfare of his family and himself This was a brief snippet of events and it is unclear what to make of the overall picture However at this point CGC has the attention of the world media and the Chinese government would like to quietly resolve this issue The question is what will happen after Secretary of State Clinton leaves‚Äwill he and his family find safety elsewhere in China Will he be allowed to attend law school What happens once the international media tires of CGC

‚ÄúAn ancient world in which neither Judaism nor Christianity had any place could not be anything for me other than a bright but insubstantial dream Only the ancient world in its fateful last centuries could explain the world in which I myself lived‚Äìa Protestant in an Ireland dominated by a Roman Catholicism which claimed direct continuity with the postRoman medieval past and a boy who looked always to the Middle East where his father worked and where the ancient monuments of Egypt and the ruined cities of Hellenistic and Roman times stood in the midst of what are now Muslim societies‚Äù This shows the importance of the idea of ‚Äòcontinuity‚Äô on his historical worldview and how his studies of Greek were more focused on the New Testament and the origins of Christianity rather than the polished but bygone world of Classical Athens

Where is your focus Is your focus on all the bad things or on what God is doing Are you just looking at the bad things or are you looking for the God opportunities I love this verse and cling to it a lot because it keeps me focused on where my mind should be Philippians ‚Äì Finally brethren whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is of good repute if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise dwell on these things So where is your focus on the negative things that happening in life or are you focusing on what God is doing around you and are you looking for and thinking about those positive things

Fourthly there was some surprise at what the CBI included within the term ‚Äúmacroeconomic‚Äù ‚Äì property prices for example ‚Äì but at the same time ignored traditionally macroeconomic parameters like interest rates With commentators scrying through the cryptic pronouncements of ECB chief JeanClaude Trichet they seem to think that ECB rates are to rise imminently to combat German inflationary pressures ‚Äì remember Germany‚Äôs economy grew by last year and is projected to grow in GDP and is expected to have inflation of for Other economies in Europe have also emerged from recession and are growing with the following EUforecast growth in GDP in ‚Äì France Italy Netherlands and Spain and outside the EuroZone UK Poland Even according to the latest EU forecast for Ireland our GDP will grow by in So changes to ECB rates are probable and of course banks may need increase their own rates regardless of the ECB It was indeed surprising that the CBI omitted interest rate projections from its macroeconomic parameters

This is probably the most common of the reasons I have heard Everyone around Christmas time seems to be saying ‚ÄúI want this I want that‚Äù This is one which worries me sometimes as well It is so easy to get pulled into the temptation of just wanting a lot of nice stuff But that is selfish and arrogant On this account I think everyone needs to step back and look at their lives Has Christmas become about getting a lot of nice stuff to you If it has it might be time for some radical changes But is what I don‚Äôt think you should do is go around anouncing your asceticism to the rest of the world and looking down on those who do not participate

Only through online resources can a small farmer or jewelry designer compete with the likes of ConAgra or Tiffany Imagine the economic benefits brought to a community when one of its members expands their corner store to the unlimited universe that is the Internet With additional revenues will come additional jobs less required welfare higher tax contributions for community services gifting to nonprofits and Churches who support social programs and in the end demand will rise for more goods and services that others within the community will find the incentive to provide hence the economic circle of life that benefits all

Tracking the trajectory of New Testament transcendence it amazes me that the idea of sovereignty stuck to God so strongly But the subsumption of transcendence by sovereign power is that strong This blog continues its commitment to reconfiguring a transcendent good that is free from the transcendent evil that sovereignty so often covertly connotes So continuing from the previous post this one explicates a transcendence exemplified by freeing the oppressed and declaring the era of divine favour

So DO bring in images or other book designs that you love or hate to show your designer but DON‚ÄôT expect your book to look the same or even similar Designer brains work in crazy ways and the designer might realize that all the samples you brought in had great Typeography so that is the angle they take You might not get it at first but ask questions Designers often have reasons for doing things that you would never think of so communicate with your designer If after you‚Äôve discussed it you are truly not happy with the design TELL THEM Your editor doesn‚Äôt sugar coat for you and I bet you appreciate that So will your designer and I‚Äôll let you in on a secret‚Ä We know when you‚Äôre lying to us we know when you don‚Äôt like it but are too nice to say‚Ä so just say it But be respectful about it designers have feelings too

Looking at it all spread out theres definitely some Romanticism going on here And as long as were getting literary Ill go ahead and say that the central American story from its early history and some would say to this day is a combination of picaresque and bildungsroman The young upstart nation making its way forging forward breaking the old rules along the way America is a DD character DD although enjoyed globally has an essentially American nature to it when played in oldschool ways And if we acknowledge that why not construct an American setting Thats Wampus Country

The grimy guitar tone is heavily responsible as it sounds like someone has hooked an IV up to your veins and pumped a city sewer system through your body Or trying to floss your teeth with rusted barbed wire The riffs cycle through streams of primitive tremolo patterns and bombastic chord sequences redolent of albums like Harmony Corruption Utopia Banished Mental Funeral World Downfall Realm of Chaos and Horrified Drums maintain a laid back but aggressive stance in the mix all raw and naturallike and the bass feels like sentient distorted ooze that escaped a tar pit one night and decided to stalk the living for their flesh Vocalist Adam Scott has a broad blunt guttural that brings back memories of the old British growlers though they also hurl forth a more surgical snarl where it can amplify the aural destruction As for the production I doubt Id have it any other way than the dry brutal honestly implemented here well suited to letting the vocals and instruments breed their own morbid puerility

The last time I saw Emily was at an EDWG meeting in late September where and how ironic this seems now she told us she had worked out her book ended At a street party Isla the child protagonist of Our Street climbs up on a table and demands silence while she speaks Once she has everyones attention she announces all she has seen during her investigations Emily described a beautiful redemptive scene in which people would first be shocked then shamed and ultimately healed Although she will never write this scene now in her mind the book was complete and I am able to share the resolution she planned here At times like this there is a strange pattern to the universe

Im afraid its worse than we even know Consider if you will that the majority of our nations industries are Public institutions where ownership is traded on the worldwide exchanges We send over Billion a year to countries that hate us so we can fuel what remains of our economy They in turn buy majority stakes in US based businesses either directly or though surrogates to control the continued flow of funds as economies shift If we shift to alternatives they are influential enough to direct the path Even domestic wealth is not immune from deception Consider TBoone Pickens and his current Green Initiatives He states hes an oil Man but advocates wind power in the plains where he is a majority landowner using Windmill Technology his companies manufacture In addition most of his current oil industry holdings are Natural Gas which he advocated for transportation use

Another reason why the vote and opinion of the Mr Justice Perfecto can not be considered in these cases is that his successor Mr Justice Torres has been allowed by this Court to take part in the decision on the question of emergency powers because of lack of majority on that question And Mr Justice Torres is not bound to follow any opinion previously held by Mr Justice Perfecto on that matter There is no law or rule providing that a successor is a mere executor of his predecessor‚Äôs will On the contrary the successor must act according to his own opinion for the simple reason that the responsibility for his action is his and of no one else Of course where a valid and recorded act has been executed by the predecessor and only a ministerial duty remains to be performed for its completion the act must be completed accordingly For instance where the predecessor had rendered a valid judgment duly filed and promulgated the entry of that judgment which is a ministerial duty may be ordered by the successor as a matter of course But even in that case if the successor is moved to reconsider the decision and he still may do so within the period provided by the rules he is not bound to follow the opinion of his predecessor which he may set aside according to what he may believe to be for the best interests of justice

‚ÄúDiscipline ‚Äòmakes‚Äô individuals‚Äù states Foucault p He explains how there was and perhaps still is power over the people through the use of three techniques hierarchical observation normalizing judgment and the examination p After reading this text I find myself questioning my perceptions of life my beliefs and more specifically how I experience this model in the school system where I currently work I will discuss the importance of the development of critical thinking lost in the constructs described by Foucault but vital for a change from ‚Äúthe ‚Äòphysics‚Äô of power‚Äù p to empowerment

Welcome to another nutty day at VCC Todays featured nuts are cashews and pine nuts Cashews are a slightly sweet nut that are fantastic as a snack on their own I love mine roasted and lightly salted personally They are also wonderful ground up into a paste and used to make creamy soups sauces and other dishes Try making a tasty cashew dip with fresh lemon juice and fresh herbs Just soak a big handful maybe about a cup of the cashews for an hour or more Drain them and add them to a food processor or blender with or roasted garlic cloves a little fresh lemon juice a touch of thyme oregano and if you like it spicy add a bit of chipotle or cayenne pepper This makes a tasty dip for veggies pita chips or crackers Cashews are an excellent source of selenium a nutrient known for its antioxidant properties These babies are a good source of iron Each oz serving has grams of protien All of this and they are just tasty tasty tasty

The ANC just doesnt disappoint After repeatedly stealing tax money engaging in corruption and nepotism and forcing Whites and other minorities out of the workplace it seems the South African government is running out of money and have had to come up with more creative ways of getting a slice of the White wealth Cue the new SARS SA tax office initiative of having all expat South Africans declare their income if they have a revenue stream or assets in the country Fancy that Why would they need you to declare your income if you no longer reside in the country Well as most wellqualified Whites have fled the country and taken their taxes with them the ANC is now wanting to know how much they can start collecting from people living overseas They really must be desperate Theyve bled the country dry and borrowed all over the place to pay for their infrastructure projects that they now have to go after those who left the country to get away from all the thieving and crime By the way I wonder what happened to all the money the Soccer World Cup would have generated for the country The tax payers are still paying off all the whiteelephant stadiums and will continue to do so for the next few decades whilst the profit was pocketed by the ANC and their comrades Well if you are an expat and still have assets in the country then best you start filling in your tax form as the ANC wants their cut of your earnings In the meantime SA Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan is heading off to the G meeting wanting more World Bank and IMF reform Oooo is the ANC wanting more free money off the backs of working people around the world Mr Gordhan Surely not

There is something about such men that really does attract women and it is too easy to woo them The pleasure is in the stalking and when the woman is finally conquered the appeal simply disappears and they are off to find the next conquest With familiarity the woman starts to see the flaws in his character and no longer strokes his ego in the same way as at first and as he seems to need Sometimes it is that they appeal to the mother instinct or to the need to nurture or control or the feeling that they can rehabilitate them Often the woman does not see the pattern and would be surprised if it were pointed out Sometimes the woman also feels she does not deserve better and is grateful for the male attention People are so complex that we will never understand it all

The economically advantaged do not seem to believe that avoiding poverty is the main issue If they did they would not be seeking to rise so far above it Poverty for them is often a shorthand term used to refer to those who don‚Äôt share their values not to mention their advantages and whom society has thus rightly consigned to the scrap heap rarely salvageable to the point of really becoming like themselves For the wealthy the poor tend to be a sort of group like public school teachers or Mexicans who are out there somewhere not doing things very well but in any case not personally relevant

He also makes no account for the often selfinterested nature of governments who launch wars for selfish gain or perhaps simply pride or other undue pressures While not stated I believe this is probably because of the bipolar nature of the world at the time Any questioning of the US government would probably have been seen as support for the Communist system growing in the East But in my mind that should have brought these questions up with even more urgency Is a Christian living under an oppressive regime supposed to feel the same way about his or her own armed forces as one living in the United States Should he or she be compelled to fight by Christian faith as well These are questions Henry does not seem prepared to answer He simply assumes the US is the normative experience for Christians everywhere and that our government is a uniform standard of justice

The one thing that Green Arrow hasnt really been very good at since the late sixties was actually being a superhero Sure he wears a costume and fights crooks but the moment he started talking about fighting the causes of problems like drug abuse and poverty and dealing with issues on a streetlevel basis he stopped making sense as a duespaying member of the Justice League Sure enough although he remained in the book throughout the sixties and seventies creative teams since then have faced an uphill battle in terms of providing a convincing rationale for someone like Green Arrow to be on the team By the time the eighties rolled around most writers gave up trying Green Arrow remained a mostly inactive member of the League his history with the team was never erased But there was always tension between the realworld fact that Green Arrow was a big enough name that he could never be cut out of the franchise entirely and the inescapable conclusion that the character himself often wanted very little to do with fighting worldbeaters and alien armadas

We‚Äôve been here before About years ago thousands of workers and their families were marching through the streets of Chicago on May st It was a Saturday Everyone left work because in those days people had to work on Saturday They were working a ten and twelvehour day Most of these people were immigrants and they were fighting for an hour work day rallying in Chicago‚Äôs Haymarket Square It was near the end of a fairly successful rally when about police showed up uninvited
Building fires were even more dangerous in those days than they are now and the Driskill was promoted as being practically fireproof Indeed in the original part of the hotel each wall floor and ceiling has several inches of concrete filled into it so that if a fire managed to break out in one room it might consume the flammable contents of that room but would have difficulty spreading to another room

A character integral to The Avengers Nick Fury was brought to screens in in a television movie titled Nick Fury Agent Of Shield It starred David Hasslehoff as a retired Nick Fury who is brought out of retirement to stop terrorist organisation Hydra from releasing a virus that will destroy America Being a television movie it suffered from budget limitations and the casting of many televison actors that gave clich√d performances but still managed to find a small audience most likely loyal to Hasslehoff and who were glad to see a somewhat faithful portrayal of Fury brought to the screen

In closing let us consider what light is shed on these matters by the attempted terrorist attacks in Stockholm in December There were two bombs in the attack The first one was a car bomb consisting of a primitive explosive device possibly containing fireworks and a number of liquid petroleum gas canisters The gas was ignited by the explosive device but did not itself detonate and caused only minor injuries to a small number of passersby This must be considered a severe failure and is indicative of the type of problem that will be faced by wouldbe terrorists who lack access to chemical precursors the technical expertise to formulate them into a bomb or in all likelihood in this particular case both

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I have nothing against the jegging or the skinny jean In fact I think in most cases they are very flattering on all differently body styles including mine I just don‚Äôt wear tight clothing and feel weird in it I feel like an imposter into the land of fashion For so long fashion to me has meant skinny I have spent most of my life trying to find fashionable clothes in the land of plus size clothing This has been an epic failure until recently Thank god designers have come to their senses in the last years Plus size clothing has jumped leaps and bounds and is now really very fashionable in its own right But the programming is ingrained and I can‚Äôt come to the conclusion that I can be fashionable at any size Especially since I still see myself as I was not as I am v is a big difference

Which leads me to the second element of the school garden that I‚Äôm really excited about the kids love it We worried a lot before we began last year about the children walking on the soil and over the plants They‚Äôd had free rein for years in the terraced beds we planned to plant but after getting involved preparing the soil making signs growing seedlings planting seedlings and seeds and watching the garden grow almost every kid in the school respected the garden enough not to tread on the plots They feel ownership and many of the kids my own yearold included consider themselves guardians of the garden and warn others against messing with the soil

Ina May Gaskin To begin with women may easily desire the impossible‚Äîthat every baby can survive if we apply enough technology and expensive medication Too many have been seduced into thinking this is true Women have been infantilized to a great degree another factor that hasn‚Äôt helped We can‚Äôt count how many women fell for the line that their sex lives would be enhanced by having a cesarean instead of a vaginal birth on the grounds that the vagina through which a baby has passed has been stretched out and ruined I just spoke this morning with an Israeli woman who had a csection for her full gestation twins years ago and still grieves about the loss of the body she once had Her figure is beautiful‚Äîthat‚Äôs not the problem But lovemaking has been painful for her ever since the surgery and no surgeon can tell her why or fix her And she knows that her surgery wasn‚Äôt an emergency but more a product of her doctor‚Äôs discomfort with the possibility that her second twin might be breech

Once one sees that there are two mindbody problems not one it is possible to address each problem in turn Chapter Two breaks down the problem of intentionality further developing the distinction between the problem of mental representation and the problem of rationality and offers two respective arguments to naturalize the semantics of intentional predicates Chapter Three offers arguments to the effect that the problem of phenomenology is a pseudoproblem and then explains how phenomenal predicates can be naturalized as well The arguments in the two chapters are different responses to different metaphysical problems but taken together they may work towards a naturalistic semantic for psychological predicates In the more speculative Chapter Four an account of the nature of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness is proposed that reflects the conclusions of the earlier chapters

With so many books fighting all year long for attention publishers could really use two more months to space out their promotional efforts rather than having to spend the end of the year focused on ‚Äúthe best‚Äù But what if Christmas keeps on creeping earlier and earlier Will the window for new book promotion shrink even further to the point where publishers can only effectively market a few books a year Or will people start getting skeptical of ‚Äúbestoftheyear‚Äù lists that cover only months or less especially if there are fewer books to consider Better yet could books actually lead the way in reversing the Creep To me that would be the best Christmas present of all

Does that mean that the first book should not be published Sadly the answer is that these days it usually won‚Äôt be ‚Äì because it won‚Äôt defined by target sales ‚Äòwork‚Äô for the publisher Yet authors and editors who have contact with youngsters in reading groups at school and library know that readers of book A exist they‚Äôre borrowers not necessarily buyers ‚Äì an impossible conundrum for publishers facing a library and school sector turning away from investment in books Yet the readers are there and if given access to forums or to authors will discuss books enthusiastically and intelligently reflecting their hunger for them
